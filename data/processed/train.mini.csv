All_Beauty,B005U5KU46,1.0,negative,these shields were too flimsy did not sick and bunched up will not purchase again,15,8
All_Beauty,B005U5KU46,5.0,positive,great product i used these for a series of interviews that i would not have time to have my suit cleaned between every interview they worked perfect to keep odors off of the jackets i used,35,13
All_Beauty,B005U5KU46,4.0,positive,the shields are made to be more flexible so stayed on all day on my jacket i had a sleeveless top under so they protected my jacket well just be mindful when you take the jacket off / put it on i will continue to use these much improved from older versions that would come off,56,9
All_Beauty,B005U5KU46,4.0,positive,they did the job but part of the pads were sticking to my skin which bothered me at first then it was okay,23,21
All_Beauty,B005U5KU46,5.0,positive,these are very thin pull off easily without residue rare the only odd thing about these is that on the crease it actually had cut out slits along it so technically a person could sweat through those slit openings on the crease of their jacket / shirts,45,0
All_Beauty,B005U5KU46,2.0,negative,very hard to position not worth the hassle,8,11
All_Beauty,B005U5KU46,4.0,positive,i can see how these may not be the best for a shirt however they have saved me on dry-cleaning for my work blazers a nice blazer or jacket is expensive and it is awesome to get a few wears out of each during either a big client meeting or a hot spring / summer day these will be stocking stuffers over the holidays for sure,63,16
All_Beauty,B005U5KU46,2.0,negative,these are good in theory but they do not stick to my clothing,12,17
All_Beauty,B006H8X3JO,4.0,positive,i recieved my machine today it arived on time and had everything in it it all works great but the coil looked burnt when i got it but after cleaning it it all worked fantastic awsome for beginer artist it could use a book of how to set up,49,9
All_Beauty,B006H8X3JO,5.0,positive,the kit came 1 day late but it is cool laughing out loud the grip is not the one they show it is straight n ink caps white no biggie thanks you,30,11
All_Beauty,B006H8X3JO,5.0,positive,i was very impressed i plan on ordering from them for all my tattoo supplies,15,0
All_Beauty,B006H8X3JO,5.0,positive,i like dragon hawk products because your tattoo kits have a great price for people like me that is starting out tattooing and i check out others brands of tattoo kits but no one had a better deals but dragon hawk is the place to start if you love tattooing and want good deals of tattoo kits ps wow your kits only have a big black ink bottle that will last me awhile and saves me money thanks and you got a costumer for life,86,13
All_Beauty,B006H8X3JO,5.0,positive,it is doing good so far i highly prefer to have my own kit because of prices of tattoos i love this,23,5
All_Beauty,B006H8X3JO,4.0,positive,it is a good starter kit but over heats with bigger tattoos power box shorted out but they mailed me a nee one with no problems very nice people i would recomend this kit,34,8
All_Beauty,B006H8X3JO,1.0,negative,when i got this it had a few problems including screws being stripped and i was not able to use it,21,2
All_Beauty,B006H8X3JO,4.0,positive,i really like my gun run 2 tattoos it is smooth will order another one,15,1
All_Beauty,B00H4EEK1K,1.0,negative,this cover does not fit the trio stealth the corner pieces do not stay in place and are not large enough to hold the tablet the case does not stay in the upright position when trying to stand it up very disappointed,42,36
All_Beauty,B00H4EEK1K,5.0,positive,i love this case it is everything I have been looking for and great protection for my tablet i was worried about the corner tabs not holding my tablet securely they hold great way better than i could ever imagine thank you,40,16
All_Beauty,B00H4EEK1K,2.0,negative,elastic clips were inconsistent on both pieces we purchased the inconsistencies allowed the tablet to not only slide back and forth but would slide right out the side and ultimately would hit the floor as although it had no case at all,42,4
All_Beauty,B00H4EEK1K,5.0,positive,these are great cases i bought them for the tablets that my grandkids got for christmas if they can not wreck them no can,23,9
All_Beauty,B00H4EEK1K,1.0,negative,i was totally disappointed one of the straps pulled out within two days i would have sent it back but i had already thrown the bag away and box with all the christmas paper definitely would not recommend this to anyone,41,45
All_Beauty,B00H4EEK1K,1.0,negative,the tablet keeps popping ouy of the little brackets not good quality at all having to buy a new case drom a different company,24,40
All_Beauty,B00H4EEK1K,5.0,positive,i really like this tablet case it fits the trio stealth-10 perfectly the claws hold the tablet very snugly to the case there is no room for play that would allow it to fall out theis very vibrant and i love the black elastic band that holds the case tightly closed and the bonus stylus fits perfectly in the ear plug outlet so it will always be available,70,61
All_Beauty,B00H4EEK1K,1.0,negative,does not work it is just another universal case just as someone else said you have to remove it from case to use camera,23,5
All_Beauty,B00ITNNI4K,4.0,positive,i liked it a lot it looks really nice on a hand and it does not look cheap the only thing that was bad few of the little rings in the chain were not closed properly so i had to fix it with pliers so that it would not fall apart,50,0
All_Beauty,B00ITNNI4K,5.0,positive,kinda big i have small wrists very cute although,9,17
All_Beauty,B00ITNNI4K,5.0,positive,thiswas well worth what i paid for it it was good quality for the price and i received it very quickly,23,15
All_Beauty,B00ITNNI4K,4.0,positive,it is okay and i like it however it is cheaply made,11,1
All_Beauty,B00ITNNI4K,4.0,positive,product as expected but although stated it would be slow was even longer than expected as other items ordered from over seas on the same day can a week sooner,30,8
All_Beauty,B00ITNNI4K,1.0,negative,very I shall fitting ring too small bracelet too big,9,5
All_Beauty,B00ITNNI4K,1.0,negative,got thistoday and it was already broken,9,11
All_Beauty,B00ITNNI4K,2.0,negative,i bought another one of these in silver and they both lose theirafter wear for about 20 minutes in hot weather I am never buying these again,28,3
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,4.0,positive,time will tell whether the caps fall off but so far so good the pens write well no skipping they do not feel cheap in the hand the little o-ring on top of each cap is small but i did not have a problem fitting it onto a small flashlights o-ring after i removed the chain the chain itself is not sturdy to the eye or feel essentially useless i would not trust it to hold otherwise I am pleased,76,36
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,1.0,negative,I have had these pens for less than a month and I am on the third one as the pens have fallen out of the caps i have the pen attached to my work badge i work in an office setting so there has not a lot to grab / catch on the pens but they continue to fall out I have been walking across the office and had coworkers stop me because my pen is laying on the ground some feet back i would not buy these again nor suggest that others buy them either,90,16
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,2.0,negative,i need a pen attached to my keychain at work at all times i have always used the mini rsvp pens from pentel most stores in my area are not carrying them so i found these sorry but i hate them they are very small for writing and since i attach them to my keychain the round plastic hole for the chain to go through broke in one day my other pens never broke thicker plastic if you just need a tiny pen and not using it for hanging it would be ok i will not buy these again since i have found the pentel pens i want on amazon oh and the chain they come on is a joke totally worthless,120,4
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,5.0,positive,these come in handy when you do not have a pen ready just put it on your key chain and you will always have a pen handy amazinglove it I have given away 6 already close friends and others i tell them where to buy them keep up the good work with fantastic ideas,53,9
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,1.0,negative,i wanted these pens to keep on my work badge / key ring so i would always have a pen handy but the pen constantly falls out of the cap so i lost 3 pens within a few weeks before i gave up they would be better if the cap stayed on and if they had colored ink to match theof the case,63,45
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,4.0,positive,do some geocaching they are not the best quality but they are great to leave in a larger geocach container for other cachers to document their find,27,40
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,4.0,positive,these pens are perfect for attaching to a lanyard so you always have a pen with you the chains are reasonably strong I have only had one fall off and that was when it got scrunched in a corner the pens are moderately tight in the cap they do not fall out with normal use but you need to be careful if you put them in your pocket or otherwise create a situation where the pen can be friction locked allowing it to be pulled loose of the cap the pens are a little on the small side but manageable for quick tasks such as writing a signature or jotting down a note there is no way you would want to use it all day unless you have small hands,128,61
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,4.0,positive,I shall have to agree with the reviewer that said the pen cap pulls off too easily if used in a keychain fashion as described and intended however i was looking for a very small pen to keep in my pocket and it works very well for that i unscrew the little keychain attachment and the lid stays on in my pocket so I am always ready to write in a notebook i carry i frequently have a better pen but not always this one fits your hand pretty well if you remove the cap and place it at the but of the pen otherwise it is a little too stubby the product could certainly be improved by making the cap fit a little tighter but it works well for what i wanted,130,5
All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,4.0,positive,they hurt a tiny bit but i love how they look,11,53
All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,1.0,negative,do not buy came all broken and in tarnish silver not colored,11,60
All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,5.0,positive,i love these i got them to make my parents crazy and it worked,14,0
All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,4.0,positive,i bought some of these and they do not hurt and they did not put a hole on you no matter where you put them i wore them all day long on my lip because that is where the original piercing is and ther was no hole left by these fake ones the reason i wore this was because i was taking a break from my real piercings i was quite comfortable with these and i will buy them again,78,45
All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,1.0,negative,just do not buy it it does not look real it looks so fake and you do not even get different colors they are all silver and break at the slightest touch,29,5
All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,4.0,positive,i recieved 6 but they came in pairs of three colors pink red and silver it was not a problem however i wanted silver ones and the price of this was great so the extra pink and red rings were like an extra they came in a small package the delivery was fast and overall i consider this to be a good purchase,62,61
All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,5.0,positive,i really like them and use them a lot i got 2 gold 1 red 1 purple and 1 pink i was hoping for on to be black but it was fine would recommend does not leave a mark but can tend to hurt for a while if you leave on for a pretty long time,55,16
All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,5.0,positive,this was an amazing buy it came in fast and nothing was broken or missing i received three gold one red and one purple i wore it around town and i had to go to walmart and my friend saw me and asked if it was real i did not want to lie so i said no it is a fake and she said it looks good on you i was quite surprised someone actually thought it was real i love it I am going to buy more and hope for more colors,90,12

All_Beauty,B010DER7HG,2.0,negative,only one of these sponges i was satisfied with and that was the teardrop the other two seemed a bit flimsy when i used the cleaningthat came with the sponges it tore through the sponges so i am no longer able to use them not very satisfied with this product wish it was of better quality,58,8
All_Beauty,B010DER7HG,5.0,positive,these are inexpensive and very useful they were smaller than i expected but you have to remember that they are essentially a brush style sponge applicator blendor they get the job done and i love them,36,13

All_Beauty,B011773O2U,2.0,negative,very hard to apply very hard to wait 20 minutes for the tint to dry the tint also did not actually peel off but i had to rub it and finally rub a damp towel over my lips to get off all the pieces thewas lighter than i expected and it was not long lasting,57,18
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,2.0,negative,eh there are much better brands this is loaded with chemicals and i can not help but feel like i am doing my body a disservice it takes a lot of time and patience to get on evenly and just is not worth it,42,28
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,2.0,negative,the top almost popped off at first use the applicator part had a rough piece of plastic so could not smooth it onto my lips super funny texture and unfortunately left a weirdi really wanted to like it but it was horrible on all accounts,46,10
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,4.0,positive,highly recommended it is not irritating and some ingredients are natural like rose hips oil aloe natural fruit essence and also with vitamin e i have very sensitive lips so i choose the lipstick that i am using jeny,39,53
All_Beauty,B0166R22CO,1.0,negative,very clumpy and goopy did not go on smoothly only used once,12,27
All_Beauty,B0166R22CO,2.0,negative,i do not know why essie comes up in the luxury category I have never liked this polish the colors are mostly bland it chips quickly really this stuff is overpriced it is not terrible but it is not high quality either,38,15
All_Beauty,B0166R22CO,4.0,positive,greati really like it the only bad thing about glitter polish is the removal i hate it,19,23
All_Beauty,B0166R22CO,1.0,negative,chipped within 3 hours of a professional manicure would not recommend i am not a fan of essie nail polish especially after buying this,24,17

All_Beauty,B0166R22CO,1.0,negative,not what i was expecting at all usually essie colors are true tothis is one exception once applied theis iridescent with a lot of yellow greens tones and even with three coats it is still translucent i have a few other colors from this retro revival line and love them but this one is not worth the almost 900 i paid,65,28
All_Beauty,B0166R22CO,5.0,positive,they were given as gifts they loved them,8,24
All_Beauty,B016KGPK1Q,1.0,negative,either i received the wrongor they are knowingly sending out something completely different i received 3 gold pins with cheap white beads on them no flowers or leaves at all and the beads do not even look like the little ones in the picture either so I am getting a refund for this disappointment,54,0
All_Beauty,B016KGPK1Q,1.0,negative,when i ordered these the description said silver the ones i got were gold they have since changed the description still i was not happy,25,1
All_Beauty,B016KGPK1Q,4.0,positive,I am actually pretty happy with these they are a very yellow gold which is the only thing I am not super thrilled with since the photos look more subdued and brassy but overall it is not a huge issue they still look so pretty i used them for my bridal portraits and they held up very well i plan to use them for my wedding now as well i do wish that the silver ones in the last photo were available to purchase as well but i could not find them anywhere,89,5
All_Beauty,B016KGPK1Q,1.0,negative,the gold reminded me of willy wonka gold,8,14
All_Beauty,B016KGPK1Q,5.0,positive,the goldis very gold almost cartoonish gold but i have dark hair and the accentfor my wedding is gold so it will work out fine but it was a bit of a shock when i first saw it quality product,43,13
All_Beauty,B016KGPK1Q,2.0,negative,the gold is very cheap looking i wanted these for my wedding but they look bad,16,11
All_Beauty,B016KGPK1Q,5.0,positive,these hair pins were absolutely perfect for my wedding day during my trial my make-up artist recommended getting hair pins to bring out and add a little bit more texture to my hairstyle i bought these the week before my wedding and they ended up looking great with my up-do and against my dark hair we decided to just use 2 in my hair since having all three seemed to be a little excessive these hair pins were so inexpensive in comparison to other bridal hair pins and totally worth the cost i definitely recommend these for a bride on her big day,103,8
All_Beauty,B016KGPK1Q,1.0,negative,the metal had a cheap look to it did not end up wearing it,13,9
All_Beauty,B017BJ877K,4.0,positive,all the rings are different sized and some fit some do not,11,9
All_Beauty,B017BJ877K,2.0,negative,love these little rings but you get what you pay for all the open / adjustable rings break within the first two wears the solid bands are a bit stronger realize these are a trendy short term accessory,36,25

All_Beauty,B017BJ877K,4.0,positive,only one of them broke and i did not like that one anyway laughing out loud they are surprisingly sturdy for what you are paying they are all different sizes after a while thestarts to get a little coppery these rings are pretty good for the price,43,17
All_Beauty,B017BJ877K,2.0,negative,these rings are very cheap the metal is almost plastic-like the designs are cute but the metal had flakes leftover from when they were stamped only three of the six were sanded leaving sharp burs on the other three i am dissapointed but contented with the few rings of the set i can wear i would still buy from this seller as their service is wonderful and everything else I have bought from them has been excellent,76,22
All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,4.0,positive,easy to use and i get great results which is important to me since i have very coarse frizzy kinky unmanageable hair,22,24
All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,4.0,positive,tangles hair too much other than that great product,9,13
All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,2.0,negative,heavy and awkward to use you almost can not use without hitting the buttons and changing the heat settings it does make a little difference but not enough to really notice the bristles will scratch your neck if not careful would not buy again,43,8

All_Beauty,B01AMSFNBK,2.0,negative,the mirror was easy to install and works fine but the reason we bought it was the lighting the leds are very dim and almost useless,26,9

All_Beauty,B00J2AJ3U2,4.0,positive,disclaimer i received this product for review opinions expressed are completely my own I have been using this skin lightening cream for over a week now and i must say i really like it is hydrating ability i have a couple dark spots from newer breakouts and uneven skin and although i have not seen much change in them since using the product i feel that with future use i will see more results the cream itself is white inand is a little thick it has a light kind of tropical scent i find it very energizing and gets me more awake in the morning due to the smell the cream leaves a not too heavy feeling on the face it is very moisturizing the moisture lasts throughout the day i like also that the product is natural with no parabens or sulfates the bottle is bigger than most creams that i have seen which is nice and i am excited to use the product and see future results overall i think this is a good moisturizing cream that has a great energizing scent and provides long lasting hydration,189,11

All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,2.0,negative,i purchased came quickly two of the products look as if they had been previously opened the red lid was gooped up and the gold was dried out i give 2 stars one for each good product the blue and silver,40,15
All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,5.0,positive,birthday present for daughter she loved the set,8,23
All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,5.0,positive,initially i ordered this product and received a duplicate colour ie blue red and two silvers instead of gold and silver however customer service was very helpful and corrected the issue so that in the end i received all four colours i have used the blue red and silver and the magnetic pattern so far shows up best on the red and blue but the silver is still a nice dark slate colour i have not tried the gold yet but generally i like the sensationail brand a lot,88,17
All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,2.0,negative,the brushes are sruck together and takes double the time to dry,12,8
All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,1.0,negative,i got a 3d magnet gel polish i tried them on my nails i work at nails salon and i know how to use that the problem is all of the gel polish got really bad quality seem they had sands inside and can not work at all especially the silver and gold one i will never buy it anymore bad and bad,63,9
All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,5.0,positive,this was part of a gift and she loved it,10,28
All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,2.0,negative,there were horrible we have used other polishes by this brand and loved them but these magnetic polishes are dried out and clumpy seller would not comment back on returns such a waste as I have seen these in videos and they look like they would work great,45,24
Pet_Supplies,B0009RSZ5Q,4.0,positive,i have two small dogs and both love this toy it always gets laughs from on-lookers but it does not float if you plan on using it near water,29,8
Pet_Supplies,B0009RSZ5Q,5.0,positive,we gave this to our puppy who is about 17 lbs he does not hold the ball in his mouth because it is too heavy for him but the long tongue is great for distracting him from chewing on the furniture he is satisfied to sit and chew on this for a long time,53,16
Pet_Supplies,B0009RSZ5Q,1.0,negative,although this is a very very sturdy product and it is as shown it is very heavy but this biggest problem is the taste of it my dogs would not put it in their mouth they would run away every time i got the toy out so i started smelling it and it has a plastic / rubber smell to it and taste yes i tried it if my dogs can put it in their mouth then i want to know what is in it i have kept them because they are just too cute maybe someday i can get a picture but that is about all i will be able to do with them i am sorry because i really wanted them and thought that my dogs would have funhumunga tongue large for medium large xlarge dogs,138,0
Pet_Supplies,B0009RSZ5Q,5.0,positive,this is my dogs favorite toy very sturdy i wish all the other toys this sturdy they last a long time,20,18
Pet_Supplies,B0009RSZ5Q,1.0,negative,i purchased this toy for our 60 lb lab mix and although he has enjoying playing with what has left of it it is only taken him about 15 minutes to get it to this point shredded to pieces by my estimate having paid around 15 for the thing this is a 60 / hour toy as you would need four of them to last a full hour as an aside I am a little annoyed at the fancy boutique pet shop that sold it to me it is one thing if i picked it up at kmart or some other discount store where i would never expect the person who rings up the sale to alert me to the fact that i was buying a piece of crap but in this case i think it is incumbent upon the owner / operator who actually asked me what kind of dog we had to be candid about just how delicate thisis I had be much more inclined to patronize his business if he had done so,165,11
Pet_Supplies,B0009RSZ5Q,4.0,positive,new puppy is quite the chewing machine she enjoyed this toy a lot and it has lasted quite a long time about a quarter of it is missing but still loved by my dog she does not tend to pick it up by the ball part although so the silliness quotient is lessened,52,9
Pet_Supplies,B0009RSZ5Q,2.0,negative,it is very cute and funny but my bulldog chewed it up right away thank goodness he did not eat the pieces he chewed off,25,13
Pet_Supplies,B0009RSZ5Q,5.0,positive,my dog absolutely loves this tongue she literally wore her other one down to a little nub and i could not find one at any stores i found this and was so excited i ordered it and had it within a few days my dog puts it in her mouth and runs around with it she sleeps with it and takes it everywhere she looks so funny worth every penny,69,1
Pet_Supplies,B0009YSCMU,2.0,negative,huh the cats completely ignore it maybe they should make scratching pads out of nice leather as that seems to be much preferred in my house to these cheapo pads oh well at least those little beasties have not discovered the woodwork and i wanted a new sofa anyway,48,27
Pet_Supplies,B0009YSCMU,1.0,negative,my cat went to right to the scratch pad just as soon as i hung it up she tried to use it an her paw nails got stuck in the carpet material she has tried it a few times and can not use it i turned it over to the back side and she will kind of use that overall pretty disappointed,61,40
Pet_Supplies,B0009YSCMU,5.0,positive,protect your doors our cat was shredding the weatherstripping on the front door in her attempt to get our notice to let her in now she scratches on this pad and it makes enough noise that we know she is out there and can let her in it has prevented further damage i highly recommend it as it is flat and we can swing it to the side to close the door solved our problem,75,26
Pet_Supplies,B0009YSCMU,1.0,negative,my two cats do not uses it good price but it did not work oft my kitties maybe it will work for yours i got 2and that was a mistake,29,43

Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,5.0,positive,this is fantastic being that i am 71 years old it took a little while to put it on but i am so happy with it now my dogs will be safe and i can quit worrying about them when i take them places well worth the money thank you,50,16
Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,5.0,positive,worked great for my 2014 toyota corolla i had to be creative on how i hooked up the bottom strap but it worked great kept the dogs in the back seat safe and sound,34,4
Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,2.0,negative,this is very difficult to get attached to the seats it is flimsy so the dogs just went around it with some serious rigging you could probably get this to work or if your dogs are not very adament about sitting on your lap essentially you get what you pay for,49,9
Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,5.0,positive,not for everyone but it works for me i have 10 dogs most are trained to stay in the back two will get in the back and immediately run through to the front this prevents them from doing that could they jump over could they destroy it yes to both but my dogs just are not motivated to do that this is doing exactly what i needed it to do it all depends onl your dogs,75,28
Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,5.0,positive,we really love this pet barrier we have had several others in the past and this is by far the best the last one was metal and looked like a cage or the back of a police car it was hard to install and take out and would not stay in place we just returned from a trip from florida to virginia and back and the kurgo worked perfectly it is easy to install and fits up against the seat so you do not loss any floor space as we did with several other barriers the price is less then any other we have bought and is really worth the it the kurgo arrived even earlier then we were expecting overall you will love it and you we highly recommend it,131,41
Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,1.0,negative,i did not like it the instructions were confusing and there were way too many pieces that looked alike,19,58
Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,5.0,positive,i have purchased kurgo products before the quality is nice it keeps the dogs in the back seat but they can still see what is going on in the front seat,31,5
Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,1.0,negative,not even the same thing was sent to my house it is so small it is basically useless i regret every penny i spent on this,24,165
Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,4.0,positive,still working with the rats to get theon but they are very young so it does not fit yet but it is what i expected and i think it will fit when they are old enough,37,6
Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,4.0,positive,i bought this so my rabbit could come outside with me in the summertime he loves it fits perfectly and does not seem to bother him if you are thinking of buying just make sure to securely latch everything and keep watch of your pet especially if they are strong,49,111
Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,2.0,negative,the mediumdoes not fit on my guinea pig although he is a larger guinea if i were to make him wear it it would squeeze his neck and chest for an average or larger guinea i would recommend a bigger size,42,172
Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,1.0,negative,i thought this leash was adorable but it did not fit my guinea pig whatsoever if there has a guinea pig on the cover then it should be the right size,29,115
Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,4.0,positive,the large barely fit my small bunnies think dutch or smaller like polish or dutch anything bigger will not fit this is made for small animals like guinea pig ferret or rat,32,183
Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,4.0,positive,this is just too cute and the quality is really great for something so small i got it for my sister she says it was great,26,199
Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,1.0,negative,we bought this for our young guinea pig and after several attempts we gave up because it just does not fit the reviews for rabbits seems to be ok but it definitely does not work on g-pigs,35,235
Pet_Supplies,B000OSDK64,2.0,negative,good price if your cats like it my cat and kittens do not find this scratch-post amusing we got this one as opposed to the big jungle-gym types because we thought it would be more appropriate for the older cat but no one likes it standing up nor lying down they prefer the rugs over this maybe I shall try the jungle-gym,61,9
Pet_Supplies,B000OSDK64,5.0,positive,this post is great for cats who like to scratch the carpet or furniture with the heavy upholstered weave it is not for all i have sisal rope post that cost 75 the best quality made and my cat barely touches it he loves this one it is not heavy and is best wedged between something or under something so it gives them a sturdy hold when they scratch i love the raised curvedas i prop it beneath a chair and it is the perfect length so it fits secure and my cat can stand lengthwise if he pleases on all 4s to scratch my cat is 17 lbs mostly muscle and has not encountered any issues pulling it out of place when it is secure in that fashion,128,11
Pet_Supplies,B000OSDK64,1.0,negative,this scratching post is useless unless you modify it like i did my cat would not touch it i ordered sisal rope and some catnip spray i wrapped the sisal rope around the entire cat tree and secured the rope with a hot glue gun here and there then i sprayed the rope with a very strong catnip spray and now my cat loves it cats are naturally attracted to sisal rope and i hated of theof wasting my money since the cat was not using it prior to adding rope another bad thing is that this scratching post is very lightweight if you use it in the upright position when the cat scratches it will fall right over so i only use mine in the laying down position so unless plan on modifying this do not waste your money,139,0
Pet_Supplies,B000OSDK64,2.0,negative,i got this for my cat a few months ago and he will not even look at it I have tryed showing him what it is and put his paws on it and still nothing I have have nt tried the cat nip stuff but hes never had it so I am not sure if that would help any i would not buy it again,59,12
Pet_Supplies,B000OSDK64,1.0,negative,not good quality at all the post would not even fit in the base,13,5
Pet_Supplies,B000OSDK64,5.0,positive,these are pretty much the only scratching post my cat will use i should have never introduced her to it originally they sold these at petco but now i can only find them on amazon they are great and last forever,41,8
Pet_Supplies,B000OSDK64,1.0,negative,the scratching post broke off of the stand when my cat used it,13,2
Pet_Supplies,B000OSDK64,4.0,positive,i bought this about a month ago my cat uses it sometimes but not as much as her cardboard scratcher i will occasionally put a little catnip on it to generate more interest although i have observed her rubbing on it at random times without me adding catnip she does likes it also i think it does better laying on the side rather than standing up,66,1
Pet_Supplies,B000WFL1H4,2.0,negative,when i sprayed it i tasted the bitter in the air i think it had more I shall affect on me than it did my pet it did not deter the chewing i used it unsparingly and repeatedly to no avail,40,9
Pet_Supplies,B000WFL1H4,1.0,negative,this was ineffective in preventing my dog from chewing things i ended up buying cinnamon oil food grade which finally did the trick,23,11
Pet_Supplies,B000WFL1H4,5.0,positive,we have a dog that always wants to chew on the bottom of the bed post we tried several different things but were forced shut the dog out of the room until we found this product it works great and has given the dog full run of the house again,50,0
Pet_Supplies,B000WFL1H4,1.0,negative,alright so i tried this on two of my pets a shih tzu and a miniature pig i mainly bought it for the pig as there was a spot of carpet she had been picking at lately and i wanted to discourage it before it became a problem well this stuff arrived and i figured i should test how good it is or rather how bad it tastes both pets generally take anything from my hand that i offer and then spit it out if they do not like it so for my test i tried a plain old scrap of paper sprayed some of this on and gave it to the shih tzu he ate it and then asked for more then did this with the pig as well same result they both sat there and looked even hungrier like when was i going to give them another scrap of paper covered with this stuff i repeated the process once more to be sure i then put some on my finger and they both licked it clean needless to say i decided not to spray it on my carpet since both of my pets seemed to love the taste,201,12
Pet_Supplies,B000WFL1H4,4.0,positive,we have got a young lab that will chew on anything and was pulling up / chewing up our neighbors solar yard and walkway lights i sprayed this all over the new ones i bought to replace the damaged ones the dog left them alone for about 3 weeks then i found one back at our place but not chewed up i sprayed it reset it and resprayed all of the other ones again this does seem to work,77,5
Pet_Supplies,B000WFL1H4,1.0,negative,spraying this on things actually attracted our dog she was obsessed with licking it in fact even more than before sigh,21,8
Pet_Supplies,B000WFL1H4,4.0,positive,cleared my sinuses right out taste and smell does tend to linger seems to deter my cat pretty well suggest using in well-ventilated environment,24,2
Pet_Supplies,B000WFL1H4,4.0,positive,most effective product i have found i used it on an outdoor tree that one of my dogs was found of eating i have both a large lab and a small aust cattle dog both were curious at first but neither were found of the smell and left the tree alone product is also effective at repelling humans i gaged nearly each time i applied it i did not try the product indoors thus i do not know what lingering influence it would have on people largest downside i see is the need to reapply occasionally i reapplied to my outdoor plants once every 10 days,107,1
Pet_Supplies,B001F6XPLY,4.0,positive,the boots are really nicer than expected however my dog hates them and tries to pull them off,18,31
Pet_Supplies,B001F6XPLY,5.0,positive,my four legged friend has dirt free paws after wearing this,11,5
Pet_Supplies,B001F6XPLY,4.0,positive,the price was great and the shipping really quick i do recommend this seller for that reason the booties work most of the time on our elderly dachshund keeps him from slipping on our hardwood floors however they do tend to slip off because they are not formed to fit a dogs leg outside they tend to slide around until the tread is on the top i think these would work much better and stay on longer if there they were shaped to fit the bend of a dogs leg where the ankle is i think i might bend them and put a stitch there to give them a boot shape instead of mitten shape they really do help although and it is so funny watching them get used to walking in them,132,32
Pet_Supplies,B001F6XPLY,2.0,negative,these fall off of my dogs feet no matter how tight i get them,14,13
Pet_Supplies,B001F6XPLY,5.0,positive,keep my dogs feet so warm love them,8,19
Pet_Supplies,B001F6XPLY,4.0,positive,i tried several brands and they would come off when my dog was in a full run these stay on in long distances the tred could be a little thicker and they make the paws sweat but other than that they are golden,43,49
Pet_Supplies,B001F6XPLY,5.0,positive,i was skeptical when ordering what seemed like such a small size for my medium size dog when the boots arrived they fit perfect follow the sizing guidelines and you will not be disappointed,33,41
Pet_Supplies,B001F6XPLY,2.0,negative,unfortunately I have had an extremely hard time keeping these on my pups feet they fall off within a few minutes of a walk,23,26
Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,1.0,negative,i was very disappointed in thisi was acutally hoping for the help of a third arm but it fails to be able to hold my dryer hose while it is turned on,34,54
Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,5.0,positive,this clamps very tightly to my grooming table and hold my dryer in place without any fuss leaving my hands free,21,62
Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,4.0,positive,i am a professional groomer working out of my mobile van after working with this gooseneck for a while having it slip off theof my table while drying a dog i decided a change was in order i have a metalon the perimeter of my grooming table i drilled a 1/4 inch hole in metal on theand through the table i removed the bottom clamp from the arm and after purchasing the correct length hex head 1/4 - 20 bolt i mounted the arm to the table by bolting it from the underside i now can adjust the arm with my free hand while brushing and combing without the arm falling off the table,119,0
Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,1.0,negative,the clamps need hands of steel to open the hose is almost impossible to aim what a waste of money perhaps the worst thing i have ever purchased from amazon,30,45
Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,4.0,positive,this was very much needed with my comando hi velocity dog dryer it frees both my hands when i drying my dog and doing hair stretching and fluffing great help now the photo in the ad is silver but the one i got was black coated i believe that for it is protection but it works good,56,5
Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,2.0,negative,the arm came as described and in a short time which was nice however i find that I am not using it at all every time i put my hair blower on it to groom my dogs i end up taking it down because it is easier to just use my hand i was really hoping to free up 1 hand it keeps falling towards the table when my blower is in it,71,63
Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,1.0,negative,poor value very high price materials used worth 500 limited use no value to us poor customer service because of return policy recommend to other buyers that it is a uselessphoto indicates that dog must be moved around to dry her / him,43,16
Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,2.0,negative,my forced air is stronger than the arm,9,12
Pet_Supplies,B000T9SDHE,2.0,negative,the ramp does not include any type of clips to attach to anything i was going to use this as a permanent ramp for my older dog to get onto the patio but it just slips off,37,13
Pet_Supplies,B000T9SDHE,1.0,negative,not a regular door so it is useless not a normal car with the width of a normal car door no way,22,45
Pet_Supplies,B000T9SDHE,2.0,negative,my daughter owns a vw jetta the back seat door does not open wide enough for the ramp to fit,20,47
Pet_Supplies,B000T9SDHE,1.0,negative,thiswas too large / wide for the door opening for my suv probably works best for vans or sliding doors,20,44
Pet_Supplies,B000T9SDHE,5.0,positive,small compact user friendly shipped on time very satisfied,9,17
Pet_Supplies,B000T9SDHE,4.0,positive,its just perfect for going to the dog park,9,27
Pet_Supplies,B000T9SDHE,2.0,negative,would not recommend because it does not hold stable to anything you have to brace it with your foot to keep it from moving while you use it depending on what you are trying to do that is not very convenient,38,26
Pet_Supplies,B000T9SDHE,1.0,negative,ramp is too steep and my lab was afraid to get on it,13,25
Pet_Supplies,B000X94LL2,4.0,positive,this is a very good alternative to the expensive brands it is just as good I have never seen a single tick or flea in any of my four dogs even although they play outside all day in the garden recommended,39,0
Pet_Supplies,B000X94LL2,5.0,positive,i have two big dogs and flea are a worry in my house i live far in a wooded area and there is a lot of brush the dogs can pick up all kinds of ticks and fleas also theirand larvae kills and repels mosquitoes works for me thank you,53,1
Pet_Supplies,B000X94LL2,4.0,positive,no better then any store bought product but it was cheaper ok shipping i would use this product again probably,20,5
Pet_Supplies,B000X94LL2,2.0,negative,I have used this twice on 2 different dogs it works ok on one but does nothing for the other i will not buy this brand again,26,14
Pet_Supplies,B000X94LL2,1.0,negative,i used this thinking it would prevent fleas but it did not work at all local pet store person told me that only advantage or frontline are really formulated to take care of fleas,33,13
Pet_Supplies,B000X94LL2,4.0,positive,i read before buying sentry pro that many of these topical flea medications can have alarming side effects i did not use quite as much as recommended rather gave my dog a really good flea bath and made sure she was dry before applying the product i have not seen a single flea since and the dog had fleas pretty bad i think it is important to mention i took several days to clean the house from top to bottom with borax and bleach and put a cheap flea collar in the vacuum cleaner bag in the days immediately after recognizing i had a flea problem i wonder reading the negative comments if fleas infest the house if any product can be effective likely some people find it easier to use the more expensive brand and if i had the extras money perhaps i would have also but i am satisfied as the product did what it promised,157,11
Pet_Supplies,B000X94LL2,1.0,negative,i put this product on my clean dogs bathed the day before 5 days ago and have yet to see any marked difference the poor things are still scratching,29,8
Pet_Supplies,B000X94LL2,1.0,negative,did nothing to control fleas on our sheltie if you have a similar long hair breed you might do better trying a different product,24,9
Software,1600775411,1.0,negative,this is a slow and tedious way to learn a language and i am running on win7 with an i7 processor and 8 gigs of memory so it is the program not my machine it slowly reads a lot of short old tired videos from the cd the product appears to be a recycled jumble of mostly old language disks two are more modern and move at a reasonable pace some disks require installing programs such as flash and quick time i do not like programs that use because flash contains spy-ware tracking that you have to go to the adobe website to disable some disks seem to repeat the material on others but in a different format if i had demoed instant immersion first i never would have bought it,130,33
Software,1600775411,5.0,positive,I have used the software for years and highly recommend it to our customers for the price it is untouchable it is easy to use installs quickly and does a great job of teaching the language in question i can not understand why anyone would actually pay ten times as much for one of the other brands that at best is marginally better and at worst is largely the same richard bangs co-founder mountain travel sobek host and producer for the pbs series adventures with purpose,82,0
Software,1600775411,5.0,positive,you get out what you put in this system let us you learn words and phrases then match them to pictures and audio with games it would be great for a child to use i had found it necessary to communicate with spanish people who refuse to learn our language i had put it off long enough and now use the system for relaxation after a long day at work this is the first type of system i have used and for the price you simply can not beat it do not waste your money on a more expensive system before trying this one,101,34
Software,1600775411,5.0,positive,works great arrived quickly and my wife is well on her way to speaking spanish much cheaper than rosetta stone,20,12
Software,1600775411,4.0,positive,great price point easy to use kid friendly reviewed by teachers and it was recommended used by all ages jr high hs and adult,24,10
Software,1600775411,1.0,negative,i got suckered there is nothing on the cds they are blank,12,77
Software,1600775411,2.0,negative,I have tried several times to give this set a fair shake but i just do not like it it feels sort of like a cut-budget rosetta stone software i do not feel as although I am learning anything the lessons are disjointed and sometimes confusing and there seem to be way more discs than there should be a language program like this can not be taking up that much memory all in all if i needed to really learn spanish I had go looking elsewhere for an effective product,84,30
Software,1600775411,5.0,positive,i have been trying to learn spanish for years most of the products were simply too boring for me to stick with it this product has a ton of content for the money there are 6 different software programs on 6 discs the only complaint i have is that you need to swap discs for each level good and bad in addition to the software there is an audio cd as well as a dvd that you can play on a dvd player and an extra game i have not figured out the game yet but it is an adventure game that you need to navigate in spanish there is no manual so it is not easy to figure out the software programs have gameshows trivia and many photos of items that you need to identify in spanish overall i give this product 5 stars because of the value you simply get a lot for the money,156,4
Software,B001RYFYYK,5.0,positive,the dvd installed the map software on the computer with the usual intuitive mac interface the first time i ran map install it prompted me to download an updated version which i did this took 20 minutes i had the 2 gb micro sd card in the gps when selecting maps to upload the interface told me how many gb they would take up and how much room i would have remaining i selected washington and oregon and clicked install the upload to the gps took about an hour the maps look great and the device just works with them without any frustration or complication i tried using the map manager software and also found it intuitive to make and upload waypoints have no fear mac users,127,0
Software,B001RYFYYK,2.0,negative,topography is fine do not expect much about trail information,9,5
Software,B001RYFYYK,1.0,negative,i have both west and southwest 24k topo maps and neither dvd drive on my mac pro will read them this is despite the claim on the face of the dvds that they are for mac and pc,38,33
Software,B001RYFYYK,2.0,negative,it does everything you need it for it is kind of annoying that it can hold all of the usgs maps for the whole us on the device at one time especially with all the advancements in data storage on small micro sd cards in this day and age but if you can over look this and the obviously exorbitant cost for something you can basically get for free on your smartphone and this software is only good for what 4 or 5 states it is just quite disappointing to me i bought this a couple years ago for about 100 so hopefully in the last 2 years the price has come down and the storage capacity on the devices has gone up if not i would never she shall out more than 30 or 40 for this software it is just not worth it when you can get all this info for free on a stinking phone,154,13
Software,B001RYFYYK,5.0,positive,this is pretty much a necessity if you want to do more than just follow roads with the gps or even if you do just want to follow the roads definitely buy the dvd although and you can share it with multiple units,43,19
Software,B001RYFYYK,2.0,negative,I have purchased the 60csx i love the unit but have many complaints about the mapsource that came with my kit first off the pacific crest trail 2000 that runs from canada to mexico which is to hikers like interstate 5 is to commuters is only listed as trail this is unbelievable also in washington state near shelton there is a campground known as brown creek it shows this as being in the national park it is not it is in the national forest this is a big deal if you are a hunter it is illegal to hunt in the park but not in the forest i have found many areas where the olympic national park is listed inaccurately if there is a better mapping software compatible that is accurate i would love to know about it,137,50
Software,B001RYFYYK,5.0,positive,it was a good product just lacked in a couple of trails which was not too surprising seeing that they are snowshoe and xc ski trials in the winter and roads and mt bike trails in the summer,37,36
Software,B001RYFYYK,5.0,positive,all the detail i expected and more some of the roads are a bit dated as in they are not navigable anymore otherwise excellent in my clunky gps unit,28,26
Software,B001RYK0JE,2.0,negative,I am very disappointed with this expensive high resolution map i use my garmin 62stc for hiking but there are very few trails on here including the well established well maintained trails prior to this i used the neo treks app with my iphone which had many trails on very inexpensive maps the garmin gps outperforms the iphone but these maps are a big disappointment,65,13
Software,B001RYK0JE,2.0,negative,garmin mapsource topo us 24k is a definite improvement over it is 100k series but unfortunately is incompatible with gps 60cs it works great on my pc but on the gps 60cs the contour lines completely fill the screen obscuring the map i upgraded my garmin 60cs with the latest firmware update but the contour lines still obscure the map i am very unsatisfied with garmins topo series of maps,69,39
Software,B001RYK0JE,4.0,positive,purchased these maps for a hike in the area of the holly cross wilderness in colorado the maps were quite good except that the trails were either missing or sometimes incorrect i used the maps in my e-trex 20 gps and i was pleased with many options that the gps provided the problem is that even the paper maps often have incorrect trails it is not clear to me whether this is garmins fault or usgs fault in any event even with incorrect trail and a gps you can easily see where your are going and whether the trail is leading into the direction you would like to go i used amazon credit card offer to purchase the maps so for me it was 40 which seems to be reasonable i am not sure i would be that content with the product had i spend in excess of 100 which is the cost of the maps on garmins web page,160,30
Software,B001RYK0JE,5.0,positive,great product very fas shipping i would buy it again if necessary,12,45
Software,B001RYK0JE,1.0,negative,the instructions with dvd are minimal and do not work nowhere on the packaging or the dvd does it tell you how much memory is required and that you might need to add an sd card to increase storage capacity the manual for my device is minimal in content poorly written and indexed the online help people at garmin online support contact you once a day i am now on day three trying toa garmin map onto a garmin device,81,17
Software,B001RYK0JE,4.0,positive,has good features hard to use need to watch youtube videos to help figure it out,16,48
Software,B001RYK0JE,4.0,positive,the first map i ever got for a trail gps garmin gpsmap 60csx segments are easily loaded to the gps from the pc on which the map is loaded i did not find the colors of the map as hard to make out as some reviewers have said the map does not have as many labelled features as I had like i was using it hiking in the escalante-grand staircase natl monument i found things on google earth for example that are not on the map but these are easily downloaded to the gps if one remembers to do it before leaving home i also found walking on an established trail that the gps tracked me about 100 feet off to the side of it was this a fault of the gps or the map i do not know room for improvement yes adequate to get you where you want to go certainly,148,26
Software,B001RYK0JE,4.0,positive,i think the map is good far more accurate than the default map which comes installed on the gps unit in order to use it on my montana gps i had to copy the data to a memory card i truly dislike the micro sd card it is very small and hard to handle drop it on a backpacking trip and you will never find it,66,25
Software,B00266PHBI,1.0,negative,i purchased this software for 3995 and within 2 weeks before i had the chance to use it they went out of business i cannotthe software at all crooks,33,15
Software,B00266PHBI,1.0,negative,tune-up is a very disappointing product it failed to recognize duplicates as it claimed it would worse i had to pay an additional 2000 to tune-up after purchasing it from amazon in order to find unlimited duplicates in my music files which includes over 5000 songs the package as shipped limited de-dupping to 50 songs it located no more than 2 dozen duplicates itunes is still able to reveal over 50 remaining duplicates without tune-up the product claims to find all missing album art but my collection is still missing album art on several dozen albums although admittedly some are quite obscure numerous albums show the wrong cover including covers from other artists entirely tune-up was a total waste of money,119,9
Software,B00266PHBI,5.0,positive,this is just what i have been looking for i am a ballroom dancer and have many songs on of old cds whose files do not come up on the computer leaving me with dozens of songs marked track 2 track 3 with no info i need to keep my files in order i just downloaded the free demo version on this program and i was blown away it took only seconds to identify organize and find cover art for some very obscure songs amazing no more mystery songs i am going to buy the full featured version immediately,98,0
Software,B00266PHBI,2.0,negative,this is like the smart phone apps shazam or soundhound for music you already have on your computer but is unlabeled potentially valuable time-saving tool but ultimately disappointing implementation I have used it intermittently for for two or three years every now and then i use it to label tracks i do not want to do manually for example when i rip mixed cds from friends and have more than a handful of unlabeled tracks too often it can not recognize a tune sometimes it tuneup just hangs working but not producing results matching album art to tunes was equally disappointing a lot of the album pics were completely wrong the time you spend correcting the mistakes makes this not worth the expense,119,8
Software,B00266PHBI,5.0,positive,while this software is awesome it is not perfect i can not imagine any that would be perfect tuneup actually shocked me i did not think that there was anything on the market that would work anywhere near as good as this I am impressed if you have any doubt at all download the lite version and test it out that is what i did before i purchased it i have not used the cover art yet but my main concern was missing info for songs and duplicates so clean and deduper are what i have used fyi you can find coupon codes online and get a good discount i have seen coupons so far up to 60 off,113,17
Software,B00266PHBI,4.0,positive,the software works on my pc running windows 7 however you have to register and download version 199 and get a new activation code from tech support they are nice and very helpful amazon needs to sell the latest version so you do not have to go through all the hoops this software is not for beginners in my opinion it works but not as expected,66,12
Software,B00266PHBI,4.0,positive,this program is fantastic it will find the correct names and order things should be put in it will find your album art it does it all you can even see videos of your song from youtube the only small problem i have is a lot of music has very poor album art i end up having to search for the album art myself but it does give you album art most are in the 300x300 400x400 range I am pretty picky and want 500 so that when i click on the album art it is nice and big other than that it is a great product and i highly recommend it,108,1
Software,B00266PHBI,1.0,negative,do not bother using this program it might work for you for a little while but eventually it will force you to update and one of these updates will break the program you will spend hours upon hours trying to get it to work again you might get lucky and figure it out after 4 - 5 hours of trying but more than likely you will just be unable to use the program for months and months possibly up to a year while you wait on the program to come out with a new update there has a reason it has so many negative reviews it is awesome when it works but it stays broken a good portion of the time I have never understood why they will not leave good enough alone,124,13
Software,B0026MTATW,5.0,positive,i reside in a rural area of the southeast the garman 2010 map update gives significantly more detail and is much more reliable than the 2008 version although I am not terribly demanding it has not failed to locate any poi that i have requested,44,25
Software,B0026MTATW,1.0,negative,i ordered the 2009 version cancelled it then received the 2010 version in 2 days 2010 version was wrong and i still have to return 2009amazons ordering is constantly wrong,30,13
Software,B0026MTATW,1.0,negative,i have tried to install it for about 5 hours at this point i have tried three computers at first it would crash early on but i was able to bypass the autorun and start the installer manually at this point i was able to get it to download all the updates but it took two hours i have a very fast connection but it was very slow it was within 1 minute of being done when the installer program crashed now when i start over it wants to download from the beginning it is not worth it if i could just return it i would but i have entered my key so i am stuck,116,8
Software,B0026MTATW,5.0,positive,the garmin gps software i purchased works as described several changes have been included i can recommend this procust,19,26
Software,B0026MTATW,1.0,negative,i want to update my garmin nuvi 765 t this looked like what i needed after reading the reviews i wanted to make sure i had the most current update i chatted online with amazon and while very helpful they could not verify if this was for 2012 or not on further research i called garmin they gave me the part number for the onetime 2012 update it is 010 - 10989 - 54 and told me the box is blue white and gray the one amazon is selling ends in 03 so it is an earlier version 2009 not the 2012 so buyer beware i love amazoncom but make sure you are getting exactly what you want and do not just go for the deal buy this particularfrom garmin it is about 10 more plus shipping but you will get the most recent update available that is what i am doing,148,4
Software,B0026MTATW,5.0,positive,thanks for the article works great thanks for sending vyu u harto po old gt km u lo re u,20,39
Software,B0026MTATW,4.0,positive,the ordering shipping and receipt process was excellent i am enjoying the product,13,19
Software,B0026MTATW,2.0,negative,i do not know how many streets changed in the two years since i owned my nuvi 350 but not enough to warrant a new set of maps costing 60 to 70 for a product costing 199 but what really is upsetting is that i have two nuvi 350s one for my brother and they will not let me update both nuvis with one dvd this reminds me of the days when software publishers overpriced software and got rigid with copy protection schemes they stopped more legal sales than they stopped piracy eventually software publishers got more friendly about both prices and second installations with lots more happy customers for their efforts garmin should have allowed me to use my 60 map update on both nuvis or made it cheap enough i would not feel so ripped off now i am just ticked off next time I shall try tom-tom or wait for a decent iphone app,153,29
Software,B002LLK5CO,4.0,positive,microsoft mappoint is good for two types of users those who need a super gps and those who need to create maps to go with their presentations and analysis with a gps puck not included ms mappoint becomes a great gps for salesmen delivery men and others who need to map out their day in order to visit several points in an efficient manner most gps devices fail in this regard they work great from point a to b and could include a detour but forget about going to ten locations it would be great if ms had a self-contained gps device not a laptop which could be programed with the information generated from mappoint by using a pc as the user interface it makes data entry far easier than a small touch screen as for the maps it generates we are currently analysing a coal mine and our pitch book was much more comprehensive as a result of using mappoint over copying and pasting googlemaps and the like,169,0
Software,B002LLK5CO,5.0,positive,i have been using this program for the past few weeks and am very satisfied with it the software installed and ran without problems on my windows 7 ultimate machine i was dissapointed that the usual irritating microsft activation technology was used if the user just wants a mapping program then microsoft streets and trips 2010 is a cheaper and more practical way to go the programs interface is extremely similar to streets and trips 2010 mappoint is for use by business people who want to research demographics and use other data available for neighborhoods they are interested in the capability for interface with excel is provided and seemed to work well,112,1
Software,B002LLK5CO,1.0,negative,i am very disappointed with this product i can not find 40 percent of the existing addresses I have entered google map finds them even mss own bing maps finds them but not mappoint 2010 I am sorry i bought it,38,5
Software,B002LLK5CO,4.0,positive,sometimes the position of the location flag is not very accurate and the data must be pristine as the software can not deal with post office box numbers that are on the same line as the addresses garbage in garbage out sometimes it gets confused if county road is abbreviated as cr or c r or even county road so clean up the data in excel before importing it into map point but for what i paid for the software i am satisfied,82,15
Software,B002LLK5CO,1.0,negative,I have had this program for a while now and i can confirm that it is not that good however it is better than streets and trips it has the same abilities but is also suited to add info to microsoft office applications i can see how some businesses could save the cost of the software very easily but if you just want a street guide go with s and t what worries me considerably is that microsoft has introduced what appears to be a very similar application bing maps this application is only available direct from microsoft and the cost varies with the number of seats you license that makes me wonder how long mappoint will be available and whether bing maps will be a better program in addition other map companies like google may already have similar applications or be about to release them i suggest you do a lot of research before you choose which application you will buy,159,11
Software,B002LLK5CO,4.0,positive,i have previous versions of microsoft streets and trips and have used it numerous times for maps and vacation plannning as well as it is gps capabilities microsoft map point is basically the big brother of ms streets and trips however it adds the ability to download maps to a gps device which is definitely a nice add-on and something i wish streets and trips could do and it adds the ability to import or link contact location data from ms outlook and display it custom maps beyond that i can not see where it really adds enough features to be worth the much higher price they charge for map point as opposed to streets and trips but it does run well and does all the functions it is supposed to do so if you really need to easily link and map your outlook customer data then this is the way to go,152,14
Software,B002LLK5CO,2.0,negative,it is marginally ok for mapping addresses and mapping simple fields but you can not do more advanced functions such as exporting business names addresses and more for this i had to write custom code and extract into excel it has ended up being of little value from a business standpoint absolutely do not buy thinking it can be used as a cheap gis tool,63,8
Software,B002LLK5CO,2.0,negative,mappoint does not recognize some major streets in the community in which i am plotting data technical support was not able to help product not worth my time and effort if it does not work properly,33,13
Software,B003YJ8WFE,5.0,positive,i have been using quickbooks for mac for several months i have no prior quickbooks experience i found it easy to use and very helpful it seems virtually impossible to mess up things can easily be added deleted and moved it has been very useful being able to track my business progress via quickbook i do not know what i would have done without it my only complaint is the fact there is not a mobile phone app for mac users it is kind of crazy to have an iphone app available for windows users but not mac users really i hope this will be corrected soon having a mobile app that syncs with my computer would quickbooks really rock,119,84
Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,i had talked to quckbooks about their software for mac and was assured that it was just like the pc version i then found out that it does not have payroll you have to do that online and pay a lot for that service was also very unhappy with amazon because i was told that i could not have a refund so I am stuck with software that i can not use another thing that i was not happy with on intuit was that they use india or some over seas vendor for support i spent over 8 hours on the phone with them just trying to get my files moved from pc to mac and they still could not do it,120,216
Software,B003YJ8WFE,5.0,positive,easy to use clean and professional looking invoices i would not be able to run my business without it i recommend this to any small business owner,27,231
Software,B003YJ8WFE,4.0,positive,quick books is a great program but the invoicing module desperately needs to be more flexible and robust i can not format invoices in a way that really works for me or add the text i need to,37,9
Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,i have loved quickbooks on the pc i recently moved to a mac and expected similar sophistication and reliability plus payroll integration on the mac i do not recommend this change and in fact I am moving back to quickbooks on a virtual pc on the mac the mac version is crude compared to the pc version and the lack of payroll is unacceptable given the even cruder and inflexible online service required from intuit if you are going to do payroll I am stunned by the lack of parallel functionality with the pc product,92,126
Software,B003YJ8WFE,5.0,positive,finally quickbook for mac i have been using for years quicken and quicbook on window platform almost went to another product because i love mac,25,60
Software,B003YJ8WFE,5.0,positive,i use quickbooks for my small business which includes invoicing banking keeping track of items and year end profit and loss statements all i do at the end of the year is print out a few reports for my accountant and he does the rest love quickbooks for mac i only wish they would add a total quantity at the bottom for the amount of items on a invoice,69,55
Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,i have been very disappointed with this product at first i could not even transfer my pc files over to it my husband did an internet search for help and finally ended up calling the company for help they walked him through a very lengthy tedious process of transferring the files i had four companies files that i wanted to two of the transfers worked two did not then when i looked at one of the companies whose transfers worked i found that none of my memorized reports had been saved it looks like i will only be able to use quickbooks on the old pc that i saved if i want to access the information because it certainly is not available to me on the mac,126,198
Software,B004DLCQZ4,1.0,negative,when youit quicken will not allow registration books and forms promised from online are not available to user,20,8
Software,B004DLCQZ4,5.0,positive,quicken willmaker premium 2011 is a very friendly product to use explanations for each section are clear updates available each state is in the select box you will have the right information for the state in which you reside,39,16
Software,B004DLCQZ4,5.0,positive,this product is excellent for the layperson it uses everyday language and includes estate planning living wills powers of attorney and many other documents you would not think of preparing for yourself or for your family members great job nolo and amazon for carrying it at such a low price i will purchase from you anytime,55,0
Software,B004DLCQZ4,2.0,negative,you must use a current version with up to date laws,11,23
Software,B004DLCQZ4,5.0,positive,i really purchased this software to review what i wanted to do and thus reducing my cost when i visit an attorney i was able to produce a living trust then visit an attorney i actually saved money by being organized the attorney actually thought what i did was a greatand policy,54,11
Software,B004DLCQZ4,5.0,positive,the willmaker had absolutely everything i needed then and will need in the future the crochet books were for a friend and she loves them the levis were for my husband they fit as they should accidentally ordered regular 501s once and they were snug in waist but he wears them anyway the shrink to fit are his levis for sure on the book have not even had a chance to start it but I am sure I shall love it,79,9
Software,B004DLCQZ4,1.0,negative,i have not had the opportunity to examine all of the software in this package deal from quicken i bought this primarily interested in the living trust maker that comes bundled in this package after successfully installing the willmaker premium 2012 software onto my vista machine i put the living trust maker disk in my pc but i did not get the welcome screen that should appear automatically therefore i followed the instructions that were given on the disk and on the nolo quicken web site when you run into this issue apparently i am not the first i wento to start accessories run and entered d autorun but nothing happened i also tried e autorun and f autorun to no avail i went to the nolo quicken support site for further assistance but found none i am just a bit frustrated i guess i will have to see if there is a quicken technical phone number that i can call for further assistance i will come back and revise this review should i have success installing the disk and after i have had the opportunity to use the software,185,13
Software,B004DLCQZ4,2.0,negative,there are very few options for anything but the simplest will or trust did not suit my needs could not return opened software to amazon but nolo maker of product gave me a full refund after i emailed them with my problem,40,1
Software,B004M39SN6,5.0,positive,this set uses both a mans voice and womans voice to pronounce words which helps you learn there are also games to make it fun great value for the price,30,19
Software,B004M39SN6,2.0,negative,some fun games and stuff you would do much better downloading a language app on your phone or even better making friends with spanish speakers the best way to learn is to immerse yourself listen to spanish music watch spanish tv and go visit and make friends with latinos they will warmly welcome you and be glad to help a gringo out,62,42
Software,B004M39SN6,1.0,negative,even after downloading a patch available on eurotalkcom the cd will not play correctly on my imac when starting the first exercise i keep receiving an error message super talk error number 13 long integer expected but found something else,40,156
Software,B004M39SN6,4.0,positive,i could not wait to recieve this i bypassed my ipod and uploaded it to my amazon cloud this way i can access it anywhere we travel to a spanish speaking country usually every year and I have found this very useful as other reviewers have said it does require that you listen and do the work i do not have any experience with rosetta stone so i can not compare it to that but i can not find any fault with instant immersion spanish,82,111
Software,B004M39SN6,1.0,negative,the speaking portion of rosetta stone is overall very good sometimes the feedback to the speaker is frustrating in that it is very picky and arbitrary however i would never use rosetta stone again unless the parent / teacher speaks and writes spanish fluently the student has no chance to learn how to correctly write or speak spanish rosetta stone does not teach grammar they hope the student will learn it through immersion immersion only teaching may work pretty good in very young children but has it is limitations as we age at the very least it would be helpful if they would provide the keys to the worksheets and tests with the answers translated in english,114,148
Software,B004M39SN6,5.0,positive,easy to use works great learning at your own pace,10,15
Software,B004M39SN6,4.0,positive,works well and came quickly i just finished my masters and should be working on my spanish with this over the summer before i go to spain,27,24
Software,B004M39SN6,4.0,positive,it gives you lots of different options to help you learn spanish with the dvds games and cd / mp3s great price,20,68
Software,B00G6CLN3Y,5.0,positive,this product works well unlike other reviewers i had no problems with installation or hangduring and a new computer windows 8 16 gig ram user interface is easy and intuitive and the results are acceptable this is not the highest end video processing software but it works well and is fantastic at this price point will outperform any software from 5 years ago at any price having played with various programs for about 15 years i am amazed at how my capability the new software has recommended,87,0
Software,B00G6CLN3Y,4.0,positive,the sheer number of options available can be overwhelming but stay tuned it gets better after a straightforward installation and some time spent updating the software you are presented with an intuitive interface there are a good number of resources for help in using it starting with a free 30-day installation support with registration the manual is a bit light and would have benefited from a competent technical writer it was not difficult to jump in and start modifying and editing clips most of it is just drag and drop cutting is easy moving samples around is also very easy there are a huge number of transitions effects and ask that will either make your movie great our very kitschy less is more all of this happens with almost instant and continuous rendering so you can get a hint at the eventual product the usual capabilities exist adding audio recording voiceovers and so on in spite of this the software is not that cumbersome on system resources importing and exporting is straightforward as well this is a solid performer that does all the basics any amateur would be satisfied with four stars,189,1
Software,B00G6CLN3Y,2.0,negative,after getting past some install issues with windows 81 i found the whole process of editing videos to be somewhat of a hassle compared to other programs I have used in the past such as windows movie maker or imovie the ui was very hard to navigate and it was just time consuming trying to figure out the simplest of features frankly i just do not have the time to learn this software and regret the time sink i spent on it,80,5
Software,B00G6CLN3Y,5.0,positive,it is good so far just testing it out to make sure it does not have any hang,18,15
Software,B00G6CLN3Y,4.0,positive,my video editing skills fall under the basic guidelines this package filled the need for some basic design concepts and was easy to use it did take a while tobut it is a large software package pros easy layout of basic features lots of options / templates for a quick start and consistent appearance great 2d and 3d rendering quick processing good interface cons snails pace install large software needs a fast processor or you lag a bit more advanced features are a little quirky to use steep learning curve if new to this program good program over all it is a nice platform and highly recommended,105,11
Software,B00G6CLN3Y,4.0,positive,good to have a 64 bit version of software i have used for years,14,14
Software,B00G6CLN3Y,1.0,negative,yes i now have two pinnacle products that i should never have purchased the other one is the studio 17 ultimate what was i thinking the product performed before par and i found it to be a pain in the neck to actually do what i wanted it to which is to help me edit photos simple right that is what i thought after the fiasco of trying to get help for the problems i had with studio 17 and being charged to get support i just gave up there are so many other programs out there that are far superior than pinnacle systems i would suggest going to your local best buy or similar store where you can speak to someone in person no charge to compare programs to your needs that is what i did after i through this in the garbage along with the studio 17 sorry pinnacle this was my last purchase with you,155,8
Software,B00G6CLN3Y,2.0,negative,found it confusing it kept adding things to the video and there no instruction on how to get rid of them i switch back to the old version of pinacle studio,31,13
Software,B01COADLXG,4.0,positive,i like this program a bunch and it has truly helped me redesign my entire first floor before i start my project this way i have no regrets when we actually start i just wish the terrain and roof lines for vaulted ceilings was not so hard to add or modify but overall great for rooms and additions and decking,59,0
Software,B01COADLXG,4.0,positive,unless you have used this sort of app before plan to put in some time viewing the tutorials and learn how to search the knowledge base when you run into a snag it is a great piece of software for creating a home design I have run into a few snags with some of the features but their resources for resolving them are quite good overall I am happy with the purchase and feel it was well worth the money just to be able to see the design in 3d,86,5
Software,B01COADLXG,1.0,negative,the software only works on newest computers so it does not work on mine there is apparently no way to return it so I am out 50 save your money and do not buy this software unless your computer is less than 6 months old,43,11
Software,B01COADLXG,5.0,positive,the reads all my old files from 3d home architect and works much better with more features,17,1
Software,B01COADLXG,4.0,positive,this program is somewhat limited but if you are trying layout a new home or look at how finishes will look then this is a good program i gave it 4 stars because it does not calculate roof lines correctly and the landscaping does not allow for contours,48,8
Software,B01COADLXG,4.0,positive,i used this to remodel a house i owned and was very impressed i had tried several other house design software programs both online and over the counter and was very disappointed with them this is the only one i could use without any difficulty at all i was great to be able to give my builder an exact drawing and layout of what i wanted without having to use an architect or sketching something up on paper then when he was done it looked exactly like it did on the computer inside and out it was almost anti-climactic the only reason i did not give it 5 stars is because you will probably find out that the standard program is a little lacking and you will need to upgrade for extra of course to a better version still it is well worth the money and a ton cheaper then hiring someone,151,16
Software,B01COADLXG,5.0,positive,i like it it has a learning curve but works well i am trying to figure out how to make the roof go over the porch but i think it is because i added the porch after i built the house still working on it,45,3
Software,B01COADLXG,5.0,positive,not the most user friendly version but it is downright cheap compared to others or even newer versions,17,13
Software,B00004Z0C8,1.0,negative,i paid a lot of money for this cd upgrade for my garmin and i still have not downloaded it after a year i took it to two expert computer shops and they can not do it i went to website downloaded countless updates and drivers and it still will not work i will never buy a garmin product again,57,4
Software,B00004Z0C8,2.0,negative,the software works fine and uploads easily the maps seem to be 10 plus years out of date since they are missing sections of state highway and local streets in the greater seattle area that have been completed for at least that long it also does not include street names for local streets only state and federal highways i noticed it does include local streets for some small villages in alaska i definately would not recommend this set for urban navigation but i do like the topigraphocal features and the shoreline markers but have not been able to determine if they are up do date,105,63
Software,B00004Z0C8,1.0,negative,not for the serious hiker this map is way off on it is accuracy want to plan a hike on your pc before hand forget it contours are 100 feet incurements very limited reference points actually had me on the wrong side of a creek no bench mark refferences use your garman gps it is a great tool but do not waste your time or money with this map stick to your usga maps,70,18
Software,B00004Z0C8,2.0,negative,i recently got an etrex summit gps and bought this software in order to download the trips i take into a printable format as well as to plan hikes before starting out on them the bottom line is that this 3 cd-rom set does not contain nearly enough information to do that i took a 4 mile hike this weekend near san francisco and downloaded it to the software it does show the track that we walked but the topographic information from this software is so coarse that you can not tell that we went up and down gaining some 500 feet in elevation since the contour lines are so far apart on the map generated furthermore the road into the park was not drawn correctly the ranger station and other services were not marked and so on in short the maps provided will not allow you to plan a hike which was the point in the first place right,155,0
Software,B00004Z0C8,4.0,positive,if you hike in areas not covered by mapsources national parks 24k then this is the only way to get topo maps into your garmin gps unit the scale is 1100000 in united states topo whereas the national parks version is 124000 so you get less detail but complete coverage one nit-pick although it is not garmins fault the 1100000 scale usgs maps are in metric so garmin converted the meter contours to feet which means that even contours like 1000 meters is shown as 3280 feet at least you do not have to deal with elevations in meters although,97,28
Software,B00004Z0C8,5.0,positive,this mapping software for my gps garmin 76csx was a great help in finding trails and roads it was close for elevation in the area thanks,26,72
Software,B00004Z0C8,5.0,positive,i love this product first copy this disk to your hard disk and then install from there then you do not have to used the cd each time youthe mapsource application also be sure to download the latest version of mapsource from garmin after you install the cd version,50,10
Software,B00004Z0C8,2.0,negative,i live in colorado and am amazed at how terrible the maps on garmins mapsource are rivers start and stop roads that have been there since the 1800s do not show up none of the trails are named it is really bad i would think that if garmin was going to force us to by their maps they would make an effort to improve them i would say that anyone with a garmin who is going to use it for 4wd roads and hiking trails should buy another mapping program to get waypoints,91,34
Software,B00005AFI4,1.0,negative,i agree poor girl i am a real newbie massage therapist turned computer user and have found this program to be a web creators nightmare i think I shall cruise on down to the freeware sites to see what i can scare up there i want a fairly simple web page that links to a few more for those of us that know the anatomy of the human body better than html i would stay away from this beast it will make the less confident feel even more so and by the way these other sugar coated reviews does microsoft pay some slouch to type them up all day or what nauseating,108,11
Software,B00005AFI4,5.0,positive,this product was very price-worthy was easy to install and has performed perfectly since i bought it it is doing exactly what i hoped and more the product itself was in excellent condition,33,9
Software,B00005AFI4,5.0,positive,i always thought that publisher 2000 was easy to use this upgrade is even easier even someone who has never used publisher before can make outstanding postcards flyers newsletters and publications what a excellent product,34,0
Software,B00005AFI4,5.0,positive,arrived quickly and in good condition with activiation code on the package i needed this to access some old files that coulldnt be opened in publisher 2010 worked great i prefer this version in a lot of ways,38,8
Software,B00005AFI4,1.0,negative,publisher 2000 was bad stupid me i thought maybe 2002 would be better not save your money and buy print shop or print master platium they work better for less money and take up less real estate on your hard drive the interface is even less intitutive that previously the most common task that even i can make word 97 accomplish will not work in publisher sorry microsoft i will not be buying this again everything the other reviewers have said times 10,81,5
Software,B00005AFI4,4.0,positive,this is a good product i have publisher 2000 and i like to added features and the new templetes realy worth the money microsoft has done it again with really great features and value,36,2
Software,B00005AFI4,4.0,positive,as much as i hate to admit that microsoft has done a good job i have to on this one the improved interface makes it so much easier to use users of old versions of publisher will be pleasantly surprised that this one is definitely worth the money for the upgrade if you have never used a desktop publishing program before check this one out you will not be disappointed i am running an entire small printing business from this program alone the only reason i have not given 5 stars is because i still want to be able to create text boxes in shapes round triangleinstead of square and rectangle,112,1
Software,B00005AFI4,1.0,negative,i was looking for a helpful upgrade and instead got perhaps the most user unfriendly software i have used in a long long time i am a software tester by profession and would have failed this product on poor usability stay with the previous version,45,12
Software,B00005NZXQ,2.0,negative,what a disappointment considering modern day programs this one is primative it reminds me of apps 15 years ago it is complicated yet limited in what it can do i have been trying for 3 hours to add a page for a digital scrapbook and once the program labels a page as front it can not be done I have clicked on everything their non interactive instructions suggest no luck even the tutorial is non-interactive additionally pages can not be rearranged once completed unless one goes through the process of copy and paste further each project is limited to 10 pages so to create a hundred page album one needs 10 projects the help section is also very basic one good feature is that the photo editor seems pretty simple to use and does a fairly decent job additionally no problem running this with windows 7 have not used any other scrapbook programs but i sure would not recommend this one,156,9
Software,B00005NZXQ,5.0,positive,to those with print quality issues it is your printer or printer preference settings there is a lot of flexibility and creative potential with this software it is also easy to use my 10-year-old who never saw it before jumped right in and is creating terrific pages can not beat it for the price,50,11
Software,B00005NZXQ,1.0,negative,i bought this product and love the results on my screen unfortunately it does not look so beautiful anymore when i print the pages out the preview and printout are fuzzy as if in draft mode all my other applications print out just fine i contacted novas technical support but the only help they offered was to send another disk which did not solve the problem now they ask me to be patient while they try to figure out my problem i have waited a few weeks now and am very disappointed no matter how great the software is if there is no real technical support it is worthless,108,0
Software,B00005NZXQ,2.0,negative,I have been trying to find a good program to scrapbook with so that i can still print out pages and not just have them on the computer this one does not print well at all I have tried printing one of thier premade pages pages I have created from scratch with and with out pics put in and everything comes out pixilized i have not had any text come out with clear edges and anytime you change the size of any graphic it will pixilize the edges i do have a good printer and can print perfect pictures so long as i do not use this program another thing i found extremely frustrating was not being able to search for a type of graphic if you want a heart or scissors or flowers you have to search through everything to find them this program would be ok if you do not want to print the pages out but if you do look for something else,162,12
Software,B00005NZXQ,5.0,positive,i almost did not buy this program because of the negative reviews but having worked in retail before i realized that people are more likely to complain than say anything posative i love this program i could go on all day about it i have so many ideas for projects and that is great because there are endless possabilities with this program you can make your project as personal as you want it to be add graphics of your own or alter their graphics to suit your mood you can add pictures and make them look antique as well as shape them into various shapes and styles add text here lighten here change colors it is fabulous as far as the pictures printing out clearly I have had no problem of course when altering your pictures if you force it into a shape that the pixels can not accomadate certainly there would be some problems digital pictures work best but my scanned ones have done well too just have fun and play with it i would reccomend this program to anyone interested in a unique and fun way to save their memories,187,5
Software,B00005NZXQ,1.0,negative,this edition of scrapbook factory is not nearly as good as scrapbook factory deluxe 4 i have played with all four editions and they got it right with the fourth one three is close and as far back as i am willing to go although you can not extract images which is one of my favorite ways to create pages in four you can create jpegs as well as pdfs of your pages and the whole program itself is more intuitive it took me all of a half hour before i had my first page done showing people the ropes of the software i gave version four as a christmas gift to a few people took all of ten minutes before they were on their way to making beautiful pages of their own you can get a copy of four for about 2000 more than this version and i feel it it well worth it many pages i have done people think were done with 40000 photoshop do not waste your time with this software evolves over time and generally becomes more powerful and user friendly as it evolves,187,8
Software,B00005NZXQ,4.0,positive,this is pretty easy to use and I am having fun with it i can not compare it with any other scrapbook programs since this is the only one I have used but from what i see this is really all i need,40,2
Software,B00005NZXQ,4.0,positive,this software gives great guidlines for begginer scrapbookers,8,1
Software,B0002IP3KM,2.0,negative,i travel on the road all the time and i use my gps and laptop to find my way around i would have to say that the software that comes with the garmin gps is a hundred times more accurate and useful i have found that many of the roads in street atlas were labeled wrong or just plain drawn wrong there is a lot of old information and not updated regularly i live in a neighborhood that was built almost ten years ago and in street atlas 2004 it still did not have my neighborhood in it and i live near a major city i can not recommend this software for other than very basic information you can get a paper map that will work better,125,0
Software,B0002IP3KM,4.0,positive,i purchased street atlas 2005 as i was so satisfied with aaa mapngo from delorme the mapping program is absolutely great it is operation is really quite simply and anyone can work it it is much better than microsoft streets which i had the 2002 version the only fault is that their data base is too old and does not seem to have a lot of the development in the last 2 or 3 years of motelsstations and resturants,79,17
Software,B0002IP3KM,5.0,positive,this is a big improvement over previous versions of this software the back on track feature works great if you take a wrong turn the software automatically calculates a new route to get you back on track much much better than microsoft streets and trips in the gps and navigation areas,51,15
Software,B0002IP3KM,5.0,positive,i have been using the 2004 version of this program for about 5 months before i finally upgraded to this version on my p2/250 laptop it runs slowly but not nearly as slow as the 2004 version did i just purchased a gps device for it and love how it integrates with it i travel extensively in my job and having the gps feature makes finding where I am going very easy there are some inaccuracies with the pois as others have stated but they are not so far off that you could not find them with a little looking around at least with them marked on the maps you get a very goodwhere they are web based maps are good to have but when you have to travel to several locations in a day it is impossible for me to get online to find where I am going with this in my vehicle i can get where I am going anywhere in the country with just a little typing and a few mouse clicks i recommend this program to anyone looking for a mapping program especially if you have a gps device to find where you are and where / when you have to make your next turn,203,1
Software,B0002IP3KM,2.0,negative,i have used delorme products for a number of years and love the features the 2005 street atlas is a little slow to start but still nice to work with but they seem to have spent their time on features and not updating the database i live in northern virginia and was very disapointed with this release street atlas 2005 is headed for ebay and i cringed as i installed,71,8
Software,B0002IP3KM,1.0,negative,problems in many areas buggy installation i had to re-install after a squeeky clean reboot on xp had to use msconfig to boot with no other drivers the software still has trouble locating well-established addresses and significant landmarks weak find function can not identify addresses with any intelligence user interface is not intuitive at all ambiguous commands poor screen / button layout I am trying to be patient and tough it out but frankly i would not buy it knowing what i know now i also have msft streets and trips and although it has limitations as a navigation tool the u / i is much easier to use no problems with installation and the data is far more complete,117,5
Software,B0002IP3KM,5.0,positive,I have used delorme street atlas since gps receivers were novel and cost hundreds of dollars i have liked every version they have put out and 2005 is no exception the reason i bought the 2005 version even although it is now 2009 is because it installs and runs easily in through wine in linux including usb / serial gps support newer versions tested up to 2008 as of this review do not install and/or run well via wine so this is really one of the best options for locally-stored street-level navigation in linux if you want updated cartography and new handy features go with a newer version all versions of delorme street atlas have significantly improved upon the version they replace and they are well worth their price tag however if you want a street-level nav program for linux that does not require internet access and uses vector rather than raster maps delorme street atlas 2005 is your best bet,157,11
Software,B0002IP3KM,1.0,negative,i bought this product expecting the excellent results i have had from delorme products for years it is been a nightmare trying to get it to work i have tried installing it six times on two different computers and i can not get it to plot a route i put in a start and finish point and it plots a straight line between the two points others have had this same problem as related on the delorme forum so it is not just my computer or my installation technique every other delorme product i have bought has installed on this same computer with no problem i have sent two e-mails to tech support and have not received any reply after five days on their forum i was told to follow the instructions for a so-called clean install but when i followed them three times i got the same result I am sending this obviously inadequately tested and bug-filled software back for a refund,159,3
Software,B004TO9M5W,5.0,positive,this product is always providing new avenues of creativity in my music recording i am constantly surprised by the avenues of creativity it presents i recommend it for any beginning artist,31,15
Software,B004TO9M5W,1.0,negative,uninstalled it was getting errors runtime errors with windows 80 pro so i upgraded to windows 81 pro from windows 80 pro but still had runtime errors uninstalled it and errors went away but i had my magix music software install no problems i stay with my magix products they work great and are easy to use,57,9
Software,B004TO9M5W,1.0,negative,did you ever beat on a garbage can lid with a wooden spoon well that is the sound you get from cakewalks music creator 6 the guitar rythmn sound is also shabby to say the least if you want a good backup music program just invest in band in a box you will be glad you did,56,0
Software,B004TO9M5W,5.0,positive,great fun i had the advantage of my brother tutoring me on a previous version there are also some nice online tutorials it will certainly take a long time to learn everything but i was able to import and edit sounds for my avant garde music class immediately i can not tell you anything about what ever is normally in these kind of programs but for me it was awesome especially at this price,73,8
Software,B004TO9M5W,1.0,negative,I am actually reviewing music creator 7 anyway i have been fooling with it for 3 months now and i do not like it for one thing the tech support is some of the worst I have ever encountered the product is not intuitive and the in-program help is not helpful neither is the cakewalk forum i have used earlier versions of cakewalk and know a thing or two about computers but this program just is a constant headache plus all the samples and clips that come with it are trash they are all house and electronica type stuff i do not see anything in the midi library and very little in the audio library that i would ever want to use but that is ok because i have not been able to get the latency down to a reasonable delay anyway not recommended,138,17
Software,B004TO9M5W,5.0,positive,product worked fine then got a free upgrade to music cretor 6 touch having issues and quirks where program now freezes up or is not responsive or needs to be forced shut because of one thing or another need to find help to find the fix to this issue also basic knowledge of the program would be very usefull since all the tutorials are not as simple as one would hope,70,12
Software,B004TO9M5W,4.0,positive,well this is not a bad daw i found out after using this that i prefered cubase or sonar which is the upgraded version of cakewalk this is however a good daw to get your feet wet or to record a few mics at one time if you need to work on guitar parts you will need nothing more than this my needs have grown greatly and can not use this anymore but for the starter or small studio i do recommend this or cubase le,84,1
Software,B004TO9M5W,5.0,positive,the music creator 6 is very cool i use it on my music prodjects i can not stop use it it cool,21,13
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00009PGN0,4.0,positive,i just bought the phone about 1 week ago the phone has a good battery life and lots of cool features the thing i like about this phone is that when you send a text message from aim you are not counted for a whole text message while with other phones if you send just a simple hi that is already 1 text message used the thing i am [ upset ] about is that you can not download new games i have tried soo much and you still can not the pixelation is somewhat ok it is not all that great and the camera does not show good quality pictures overall this is a good phone it has lots of nice features lots of ring tones and more you can download including wallpapers t-mobile customer service is great also but they need to expand their coverage area if you are looking for a phone to buy for just talking all the time then buy this one because it does give good battery life i did not have to recharge it for about 2 days and i was talking on the phone and i was on t-zones all the time now that is a good battery life if you do not like this one there are others like it out there the t720i t721i and that is about it,221,19
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00009PGN0,1.0,negative,I have been a t-mobile customer for many years but am very disappointed with my current phone the motorola t720i now called the t722i my first complaint arose on my first call the earpiece volume is very low even at maximum volume and some calls just have to be ended if they are being made in an environment with any background noise many other complaints followed most dealt with hardware quality my 1st one had a flaw in the flip mechanism that caused the phone to think it was being flipped shut when it was not ending calls unexpectedly the 1st and 2nd ones would routinely freeze up during calls the signal strength meter indicated full strength and the call timer was still counting but the person on the other end could not hear me anymore and was soon disconnected this daily occurrence required me to contact t-mobile and get a 3rd one of these phones which I am sorry to say still has the strange freeze problem all 3 have had the maddeningly low volume as well resolution and variable light functionality on the camera attachment are horrible as well as is thequality on the display in general it just looks washed-out almost black and white at times despite adjustments the good news is that customer service is great at t-mobile and they always replace the phone when i have problems avoid this phone however I am going back to nokia,237,16
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00009PGN0,5.0,positive,i recently purchased this phone from amazoncom for 9999 I am telling you this was definatly worth it this is one of the best phones out there now all the good features this phone is really worth it and the t-mobile service is great to do not waste anytime hurry up and purchace this phone motorola t722i,55,15
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00009PGN0,4.0,positive,well worth [ the ] pro voice dialing is good although of numbers is limited backlighting is cool volume is loud enough mini antenna small price looks cool does not heat up much con somewhat slow screen touches your cheek when you talk ring tones and wall paper cost 99 with t-mobile camera absolutely stinks do not buy this phone for the camera i would suggest it,69,26
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00009PGN0,1.0,negative,i had this phone for about 5 days before i wanted to toss it out the window it rings when there is no call comming in and will not stop i returned it to the store where i bought t-mobile it but because it had been 35 days instead of 30 they said they could not exchange it for a new one but would give me a previously used phone after 5 replacements i bought a nokia the camera sucks and the battery life and signal suck too,87,4
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00009PGN0,2.0,negative,the phone is not really bad to say but could have been designed better for example the camera is seperated from the phone which makes it hard to grab it with you all the times,35,12
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00009PGN0,3.0,neutral,this was an ok phone do not look forward to taking many pictures with your camera because it is terrible all this phone is is a mixture of a motorola v60 and a motorola t720 it is a pretty simple phone if you have second thoughts about this phone buy the nokia 3650 or the samsung v205,56,37
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00009PGN0,5.0,positive,with this being my first wireless phone i am extremely pleased i was a little leary about buying a phone with rebates but everything worked out fine the features this phone has are amazing the battery life is great i let it charge for about 18 hours and it has not been charged again and it is been 2 days thescreen could be sharper but i can not really complain it comes with a ton of ringers and sounds overall this is a great phone i did not buy the phone for the camera good thing because the camera is really [ does not work very well ] it takes decent pictures for a small screen but like i said i did not buy it for the camera pros compact size easily learnable the address book might take you a while chock full of features beautiful phone very attractive wonderful phone cons camera internal antennae no problems yet but i like external,163,27
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002F7I94,2.0,negative,with my rim 7290 the hs810 is barely audible in other than a quiet setting listeners also complain about outgoing sound as muffled features and design are great but sound quality is not good enough to substitute an in-the-ear headset other than in very quiet surroundings,45,0
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002F7I94,1.0,negative,this headset was a piece of junk right out of the box i had nothing but problems with it and threw it away after the first day,27,5
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002F7I94,5.0,positive,I have been using this now for about a month and i am very happy with it quality is good and i have not had any problem with loudness or battery life I am using it with a 7520 blackberry,37,36
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002F7I94,1.0,negative,this brand of bluetooth earpiece does not provide a snug fit to the ear more particularly for a womans ear which is smaller try using a wrap around unit that goes down the back of the ear as opposed to across the top as this one does the hs810 literally fell from my ear if i tilted my head and never had a good fit even sitting still i would recommend another blue tooth option jabra has a nice one,80,45
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002F7I94,4.0,positive,well i am not that much into electronics and do not fusss as long as they work prefectly the reason i have given four stars is that the design of the headset it feels like it will fall off it hangs on but pretty precariously i can not use in crowded places for the fear of losing it otherwise the reception is excellent the voice transmission is also good it also has pretty good life can work all day,75,13
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002F7I94,5.0,positive,i purchased this headset so i could use it with my motorola v551 the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature so far i have no complaints about the sound quality very clear and people on the other end are surprised when i tell them that I am using a bluetooth headset no problems with sound quality while driving as well this device will attract attention in a good way you will get questions about it from friends and strangers the range is very decent I have been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no reception / sound quality issues this is a great product so far this is my second product from motorola both my cell phone and headset a such great quality products that they may have made themselves a loyal customer out of me or a least a great fan of their products,166,54
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002F7I94,2.0,negative,i have had this headset for several months now and not liking much about this headset other than it is long battery life this headset works ok but the sound quality is poor and it does not function well in conditions other than perfect ie no background or wind noise and very close to handset i do like the feature of the headset turning off when boom mike closed because that is where the battery savings comes from other than that i find nothing redeeming about this headset i believe motorola will discontinue this model because of it is severe flaws,98,33
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002F7I94,4.0,positive,for using it with my nokia 3650 and any other s60 phone it is great the 810 is compatable with pretty much anything from what my studies show this design also is nice for a easy on and off function compaired to the 820 this is better the 820 does not have a flip open design so you can not easily turn it on you need to push the button which is annoying i rather open the mic and it be ready for me for talking on the phone it is great however for doing everything else listening to movies musicthis headset sucks sound levels are off distorted and so making the wired headsets better however i do use my headset daily and well could not live without it also since mine came with a car charger too it is perfect the carrying case has never sliped on me either when i latch it to my belt comes with a neck strap too but i never use it so if your looking for a nice device to rely on this would be the one never had any problems yet and hope i never will now if only motorola would make a better plug charger hate this 3 pin one normally those will break sometime down the line it seems hope mine does not,218,48
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,4.0,positive,i bought this phone based on published features just to find out verizon disabled some of these i can not understand a company who has so much going for them coverage clarity would risk upsetting their customer base verizon could gain so much more by giving us access to the technology and making their services very affordable so more people would sign up for them instead of disabling features and choosing to nickel and diming us to death instead verizon are you listening shame on you you should fire the guy who made that decision i like your service but i hope you loose to motorola that was underhanded i want my bluetooth multimedia / data transfer back,115,62
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,5.0,positive,this is a mid-priced phone with solid features all-around including bluetooth good reception nice compact size and good battery life if you buy it with those expectations you will be very happy with it compared to the higher-end phones although it has some drawbacks I have had it for a few months pros reliable very good reception an improvement over prior phone from a couple years ago compact bluetooth works with headphones and car not with pda photos and movies these are just novelty features to me but they work I have sent little video clips I have taken to another phone kind of cute loud ringer web browsing cons web browsing is pretty slow and limited the organizer features are not great the add-on motorola tools software for connecting to outlook is kind of clunky the cons are relative to what you would get on a higher end more expensive phone like a microsoft win-ce enabled phone if you compare to similar price-point phones this one is a very good value,178,40
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,3.0,neutral,but verizon only had this for the bluetooth i got it when it came out and i was extremely pissed off for a month i could take the lousiest pictures that i have ever seen it was like you pause your vcr on a horribly recorded tape i had another phone before this with at t for over a year and that was not a megapixel but 640x400 well it was less resolution but each picture came out 1000 times better in light and otherwise even outside the fotos come out very bad put it this way i never use the camera anymore even when i say i wish a had a camera to take a funny foto of someone it is a bluetooth enabled phone which works so so with the 820 motorola headset i do not think you should buy this if you need a camera phone only if you need a bluetooth phone with verizon if there are none others around very dissapointed with the motorolla phone it was my first and ia had heard many good things about it which this phone made me forget them and just think of the horrible quality of this phone oh and i heard that there is or was a recall on the first wave of these phones on the camera lens i returned it and i got another replaced for free at least i made motorolla pay for it is crappy phone they put out there and it is quite big for phones out there which are getting smaller every day the v600 is much better and a bit smaller if they had it for verizon i would have gotten it in a heartbeat,280,93
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,3.0,neutral,generally this phone is fine the pics are awful that might need to be fixed although otherwise it is fairly easy to use,22,18
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,4.0,positive,just got it 2 days ago it took me a long to finalize this phone as everyone had mostly negative reviews here in amazon on cnet and more well the camera is not that bad it is as good as what you should expect from a cell then the voice quality is superb and it is so loud and clear you will love it the reception is great everywhere i guess this is the only bluetooth only voice choice from verizon and it has all other features of speaker phone and so on i guess it is a nice choice kaushal,95,81
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,4.0,positive,I have had the phone for 4 months now this phone has great reception my friend has a kyosera slider and i always get extra bar camera only works in daylight you need trans flash card tomidi / mp3 ringtones but the sound is great i did invest into the usb cable and motorola sync software now I am able to sych my outlook contacts with the phone calendar sync is the possibility as well but i do not use it the holster is cheap and cracked pretty soon had to go and get a bodyglove case which is quite good battery life is ok i get 2 - 3 days out of it with light use,115,83
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,5.0,positive,this phone is incredibly user friendly picture of person calling appears next to their name if you store them next to phone no speaker phone is also a nice feature,30,64
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,3.0,neutral,my title says it all i have been to three different verizon stores trying to get these items corrected but keep getting directed elsewhere when the phone works it is nice but half of the time my phone does not ring the ring is too soft even when set to loud and the battery life is bad,56,42
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0009F1ST8,3.0,neutral,this phone is small and has the advantage of being able to operate just about anywhere because of it is quad-band capability which not a lot of phones have the complaint about a pouch case below is not valid you can buy a wide variety of after-market cases cheap ring volume is fine speaker volume is fine there are functions that I shall never use on this phone and the small buttons can because you to enter those functions aol messengerby mistake my previous phone a v60 had a convenient external button for voice activated dialing and was built sturdier this one looks like if i drop it it is done for and voice activated dialing requires you to hit two keys in succession which is a bother the manual this phone comes with might as well be written in urdu it is that opaque but you can find out how to use this thing by checking online forums overall a decent but unintuitvely designed phone that gets the job done for the price it is probably a good value if i had to do it over again I had probably spend 50 more bucks and get something designed better but it is hard to find a quad-band phone that does not have even more unnecessary features than this one ps one year update one of the buttons stopped working i used some computer spray to clean out the dust still did not work i opened up the back to get at the keyboard there are no screws to open up the phone just permanent rivets it is not repairable or cleanable i went to the phone service provider to see what he could do he said i needed to get a new phone so much for quality goods,292,35
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0009F1ST8,1.0,negative,i have not been happy this phone is horrible they replaced part of it and it still does not work right i tried customer service over and over the only way to get help is to refuse to pay bill until they respond to the problem not happy all the way around,50,13
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0009F1ST8,4.0,positive,while the list of things this phone does not have is long what it does have is far more important it has functionality it does what it says it will do with little or no deviation if with motorolas quirks this is a quadband world phone with speaker the best thing about this phone over older motorolas is that saving phone numbers default to the sim versus the phone memory making it much easier to keep all your phone numbers the next time you switch devices,85,26
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0009F1ST8,5.0,positive,i got one of these for my mom and one for myself as a former cs rep for a major wireless carrier i consider myself to be well educated in cell phones pros flip phone light small responsive cpu keys are spaced well and responsive for fat / shaky fingers excellent speakerphone that works while the she shall is closed very long battery life ring tone can be switched from loud to vibrate to silent by using volume keys in standby standard moto feature cons not flashy no mp3 or impressive audio features to gloat about like i said very practical non-standard moto charger you will need a new car charger if you have the 3 pin funky moto connector they have used for years,122,30
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0009F1ST8,2.0,negative,this is my first moto phone and I am not happy with it at all before this phone i had a samsung when it was time to get a new phone i went for the v188 because it is small and inexpensive i was very happy with the phone at first easy to use you can probably get away with not having to look at the manual and the sound quality was pretty good after only six months of having the phone I am having problems like dropped calls call failure and lots of static needless to say i can not wait to to get my new samsung that will be arriving in a couple of days,112,16
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0009F1ST8,4.0,positive,as a long time nokia user i was sceptical about switching to a motorola phone but since nobody wants to offer the nokia flip phones i decided on the v188 first of all t-mobile was offering it for free so what did i have to lose i like the small size the blue lighting on the keys and i was surprised at how good the sound quality has been the basic functions are easy enough to figure out on the menu but sometimes i still have to hunt around to change something overall i would recommend this phone and i would recommend t-mobile it does not offer the camera or video of other phones but i think it is a great basic phone,122,31
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0009F1ST8,4.0,positive,i have had this phone for over four months now i have not had any of the problems listed by other users except for the size of numbers-they are a bit small i have gotten excellent reception with this phone even inside most stores and when using over bridges both places where i have had no reception with other phones including other motorola models sound has always been crystal clear no echo and rarely breaks up i really enjoy this phone and agree that it is excellent for a low-end model sturdier and higher quality than samsung in my opinion,99,21
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0009F1ST8,4.0,positive,I am in the pro-v188 camp i think it is a solid good-quality cell phone thescreen is a bit small compared to more expensive phones but hey you get this for free before the generous rebate so stop bitching about this not being a high-end phone for it is not meant to be a high-end phone it has good reception and voice quality and is built rather like a tank solid durable a little on the thick side if you want something stylish go with a razr or pebl or slvr if you want something small and lasts forever go with a sanyo pcs phone for sprint but the v188 is a good basic phone no doubt about that,118,12
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000E95OAI,2.0,negative,giovanni everything you said about this phone is true the setting up of the contacts is the most idiotic set up i have ever seen there is a way to search for contact with out having to go through all of them individually but it is so complicated and the manual is of no help and i already forgot how i managed to set it up the phones menus differ greatly from the manuals description of what they are needless to say i was happier with my old nextel that was 3 years old too,96,4
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000E95OAI,5.0,positive,this is the best phone i ever owned reception is very good battery life is good ring is audible and quality of voice is very good mine already came with ear phone usb cable leather case and 256 mb memory card there are a few things that are not so good need to clean cover frequently it gets easily smudged mp3 sound is not perfect well this is a phone not a mp3 player once when i switched the gsm card it reverted to kanji characters and i had a hard time to find the english option,100,63
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000E95OAI,1.0,negative,this product did not work well after 2 weeks it stopped reading my sim card on a regular basis thus i had to by a new phone when out of the country thus i wasted 80,36,18
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000E95OAI,4.0,positive,my v3i shipped with a 256 mb card and itunes allowed a maximum of 50 songs bought a 512 mb card and still only 50 songs hope someone can hack this soon since card can fit far more otherwise i am very satisfied with the phones other features update itunes not compatible with bluetooth either once bluetooth module is connected itunes continues playing but not audible through headset,66,0
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000E95OAI,5.0,positive,i have several of these phones already this one is to replace one that is more than 6 years old these phones are great for what i need and having a quad-band unlocked phone is imperative for overseas travel for less than 6500 incl s h is a steal,48,28
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000E95OAI,4.0,positive,excellent phone overall with one limitation unless i am doing something wrong when you start search you can type in the first letter of the name you want to get to and it will take you to the names in your phone book that start with that letter but no second letter search to narrow the look up eg if i am looking for moly i will get all the ms and will have to scroll down from ma all the way to mo is that a good thing or am i wrong,93,73
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000E95OAI,5.0,positive,excellent phone i used this phone every time i traveled internationally the signal are very good and fit in your pocket nobody knows that you have a phone,30,10
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000E95OAI,2.0,negative,i love razrs i owed a v3 t which was amazing i can not find one like it i thought that by buying this v3i with expandable memory I had be able to store m 80 txts but apparently the text mssg are saved on the sim card not the memory card also this unlocked version will not allow you to receive or send picture messages stay away from this phone,68,34
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000EGT1S2,1.0,negative,the pouch looks nice and works for the phone purchased but the clip on the that goes on the back keeps coming off you could lose your phone so that makes the pouch unuseable,34,13
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000EGT1S2,2.0,negative,i liked it at first but it is already started tearing at the point where the clip is attached to the pouch the reason I am not giving it 1 star is because I am not sure if i was rough with it,40,45
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000EGT1S2,3.0,neutral,first i am not sure what has up with amazon this product went from what i paid 1050 may 06 to 1449 aug 06 now other amazon vendors are selling it for 5 6 but no amazon prime and 5 shipping over all i have not had the problems mentioned above the swivel seem sturdy and keeps it in place and my stictching is fine it is not the perfect solution but what you see is what you get,74,47
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000EGT1S2,3.0,neutral,the only thing i do nott like is that the pouch itself is almost three times the thickness of the phone,20,44
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000EGT1S2,5.0,positive,i originally bought thisto go with the unlocked motorola razr i ordered from amazoncom but never ended up with but the pouch is great it does not give full coverage as the sides are open to allow for charging and more it is good soft leather good sturdy construction a belt clip that is removable but stays put when you want it to so it fits flat in a small or crowded purse i know you can not go too wrong here sure i never got the unlocked motorola razr from amazoncom had no choice but to stay with my current provider because i could not get what i needed in time from amazoncom but the case fits my locked motorola rapture vu30 that i had to purchase from my current and way too expensive cellular provider as my lg phone finally broke in half the pouch is not cost effective to pay to return for refund as shipping is almost as much as theitself please do not let my misadventures with my first attempts to purchase from amazoncom make you nervous friends and family have purchased from amazon with great success my experience with their sales and service reps through all of this was top notch i have great appreciation for their patience and dedication to try and make things right for the customer,224,17
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000EGT1S2,1.0,negative,why can not they get it right they design a sweet sleek black leather sheath for the sleek motorola razr v3 series then they stick this big fat plastic gizmo they call a belt clip sometime in our distant past someone decided celluar phone holders should swivel that of course was when cell phones were the size of small bricks and weighed as much well times have changed and so have cell phones wake up already a small safety belt clip is all that is needed and it does not have to swivel,92,27
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000EGT1S2,3.0,neutral,I have used a few different designs and by far this one is my favorite most of the other ones i used where either bulkier or did not have a flap that sealed the top of the case therefore the phone would still fall out i do recommend this design if you plan to wear it on your belt or leave it in your purse if you like to carry it else where car pocket the button that attaches to the clip for your belt you will most likely find cumbersome i also recommend you buy three at a time reason the belt clip tears the leather rather easily getting in / out of car there cheap enough but be careful there are sellers that still charge you separate s h on each order despite the fact they send them together i paid 1485 for shipping even although they combined my 3 into one package and usps only charged them 285 to ship i doubt packaging and handling was another 12 that is how they can offer them for 3 each,176,26
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000EGT1S2,1.0,negative,i did not even receive thethat was shown the one sent was cheaply made with a cheap plastic clip that broke immediately i let the seller know but they did not respond so obviously they are not concerned with making their customers happy,42,25
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000EIXG7C,3.0,neutral,purchased the h3 to match up with my v3 razr which it does very well the h3 connects easily and quickly when turned on it is very comfortable and looks quite stylish two problems 1 the maximum volume level is too low this makes it difficult to use outdoors or in a car if wind and extraneous noise are present 2 the volume controls are tiny and dificult to use i leave mine set on the maximum and use the v3 volume control if necesary rarely to lower the level i like the h3 and intend to keep it for indoor use when outside or driving i use the cardo scala 500 which has great volume capability and wind noise protection the scala 500 is slightly less comfortable but overall performs far better,133,31
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000EIXG7C,2.0,negative,tried pairing it with a treo 650 and red razr although pairing worked fine the other party heard an annoying buzz on both phones where as i could hear them clearly returned it to amazon for a full refund i gave it two stars because the headset seemed to work on my end,53,15
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000EIXG7C,2.0,negative,fair headset size weight comfort and battery life is good the incomming sound quality is very good problems start with outgoing sound people tell me i sound like I am in a tube with echos volumn control hard to adjust talking outside can at times be only fair and the directions with the units beeping is not easy to remember,59,26
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000EIXG7C,1.0,negative,out of the box mine had one of the buttons dead no click nothing when i returned it for exchange the saleperson said that is typical of this headset and only from motorola cellphones good h3 headset junk in fact he said that they cellular sales a verizon dealer store were dropping the motorola h3 because of the exceedingly high number of returns and were sticking with just the plantronics which i then had him exchange my shoddy h3 with so mine out of the box essentially doa with a major dealer dropping them because of this,98,17
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000EIXG7C,3.0,neutral,got the h3 two months ago paid 9 more than todays price it is a decent unit but there are some drawbacks the earhook does not make for a secure fit to your ear but that is an issue for most bt headsets sometimes my h3 will not boot on the first key press after a recharge or sitting in a warm car for a few hours occasionally there has an echo on dialed calls and the call key requires a firm push if you are not careful powering the unit off you might inadvertently redial the last number instead,94,8
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000EIXG7C,1.0,negative,do not get me wrong the h3 looks good and sleek but it gives too much feed back what i mean by that is that when your on the phone the other party hears an echo this happend on all the calls the only thing that kept me from returning it was that i lost the receipt and i threw away the box i do not recomend wasting your money on this one you may try that has worked for me is the h500 cheap looks ok and best of all it works oh yeah my razor had a hard time linking to the h3,103,9
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000EIXG7C,5.0,positive,no comment everything is ok regards cristian,8,19
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000EIXG7C,5.0,positive,i can not understand all the negativity about this earpiece / headset i have been through three other types and models and this is the best one for me so far i like the fact i can use the same charger for my motorola slvr 7l phone and this headset setting-up was a breeze easy to pair with the phone the on-off button is great the battery life lasts a long time even with my headset on most of the time and all the talking i do it lasts a long time on one charge i have had this model for two weeks now and i have had to charge this only twice once a week it fits great on my ear and has not fallen off yet it fits so well and comfortably it is so light that i wear it all day long and even sometimes i forget i am wearing it there has been a couple of cases where i experienced a little static but it never lasted very long i have had no problems with the volume or controls i hear great even while driving the sound quality is just great this is a great bluetooth headset i recomended it,200,21
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GUKT9Q,5.0,positive,it is great for clarity anf long lasting battery,8,19
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GUKT9Q,4.0,positive,i ordered it for a friend of mine i am on my second one of these the first was lost good for the money you get what ya pay for but it is worth the price got to keep the background noise down but i am pleased,43,45
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GUKT9Q,3.0,neutral,this bluetooth headset has not given any real problems since i bought it it charges quickly but it is difficult to flash between calls at times the earpiece volume is quiet and other times there is an echo for the person on the other end of thebut overall it works well functions as it should at least 90 of the time,63,139
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GUKT9Q,5.0,positive,i owned this bluetooth before and also previously owned the motorola h500 as well as a couple of others nothing beats the motorola bluetooth headset and my original one lasted over 7 years even although i broke cracked it and glued it back together and it continued to work until it just gave out i like that it hangs snugly around your ear and nothing protrudes into your ear it lays flush against your ear i never have a problem hearing and no one has a problem hearing me it is very easy to operate and the range is better than the phone range itself i love being hands free and hate when anyone calls on the home phone because i can not be hands free unless i put them on speaker i would recommend this bluetooth for anyone looking for an easy comfortable and long lasting bluetooth,147,30
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GUKT9Q,2.0,negative,feels like it is falling off the entire time it is worn works in a pinch but not my favorite,20,67
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GUKT9Q,3.0,neutral,the volume is lower than I had hoped for,8,16
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GUKT9Q,3.0,neutral,i must say that this bluetooth is really a nice looking conservative earpiece i have seen the more bulky conspicuous type headgear and i was not interested however sometimes it is challenging to just hit the button to end a conversation it seems as if it does not catch i did not have this problem with my other motorola i loaned it to my dad to see if it would work for him and he had the same problem,76,119
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GUKT9Q,4.0,positive,this is a much much better headset than the old hs500 this has the bt 20 standard it delivers better range also known as more than ten feet great sound quality and works with more devices than anything I have seen in a similar price range the battery life is great too it is downsides are the multifunction button that is way to easy to press and the fact that it does not have the ability to filter out non voice sounds,78,172
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,4.0,positive,i like everything in this bluetooth but it would have been perfect if apart of having a voice command asking you what number you want to call it would have a voice command telling you who is calling everything else is very good good volume clarity and reception,48,30
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,5.0,positive,my original product was defective it took a while to get it back in my hands but all is well now,21,173
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,2.0,negative,the product hardly stays fit in the ear and both sound and microphone qualities are not so good i would not recommend it,23,140
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,5.0,positive,i will be honest for the price i was not expecting too much it is sooo comfy on my tiny ears it sounds so clear and everyone hears me just fine well worth buying,33,75
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,5.0,positive,i got this for my boyfriend now that ca has the hands free law while driving he loves this earpiece it is way better than the plantronics one i bought for myself on a lightning deal and it was cheaper sometimes his phone does not get reception in our apartment and he will actually use the bluetooth because it gets better signal so this earpiece actually improves is phone in bad reception areas best purchase I have made and the shipping was super fast it arrived in only a few days,87,60
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,5.0,positive,from all the previous reviews i am assuming that there might be some compatability issue between the headset and some phones or maybe some of these just come bad the one i recieved works great i can hear people just fine especially with the audio setting turned all the way up I have noticed that when i am in a loud room often people have a hard time hearding me but in the quiet of my car I have never had any complaints for me this headset has been worth it is weight in gold,92,209
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,4.0,positive,bought this blu-tooth to replace another that was uncomfortable the outside the ear design works great for me light weight i hardly notice it is there,26,45
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,5.0,positive,fast friendly service i ordered my blue tooth headset and had it lightning fast i am very pleased with the product i recieved it is as advertisted i will do business with this company again as the need arrives,39,183
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000HDGAEU,4.0,positive,for the money this is a great buy this is my first bluetooth headset and i have to admit I am hooked my only problem is learning how to press the buttons to get the right response connect hold disconnect and more maybe it is me,42,26
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000HDGAEU,3.0,neutral,the motorola hs815 bluetooth wireless headset blue / siver is just a little bit heavy but have a good transference of sound and it is listened to strong,27,13
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000HDGAEU,4.0,positive,i can not complain for 15 bucks does what it suppose to and is being very useful companion for my phone,20,24
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000HDGAEU,2.0,negative,this device hurt my ear i was trying to replace my old set with this one but have to return it it is not flexible enough so it takes a few minutes to put it on and requires both hands once it was on my ear started hurting bad outdated product pay more buy somthing better,56,21
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000HDGAEU,3.0,neutral,the on / off switch is very sensitive and turns on when being carried in case or handbag making it necessary to charge more often the car charger was not compatible with razor model 3v i had there was no clue to this when i ordered it and had to buy an additional car charger seems otherwise fine,56,15
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000HDGAEU,5.0,positive,reception and transmission are excellent it is very easy to use and is quite comfortable at the price purchased the hs815 gets a big thumbs up,26,29
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000HDGAEU,5.0,positive,it is a great product for the money very pleased with the unit and the people who i bought it from,21,19
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000HDGAEU,1.0,negative,i hate this product it only lasts after one conversation this is what i get for buying a used product sometimes buying new is the best,26,12
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000NIAS7O,5.0,positive,i have owned two other bluetooth headsets and neither of them worked as good as this one it may be because i was using an lg phone and not an lg headset but in both cases they provided poor quality for both hearing others and for others being able to understand me this is the first one that i have ever had that performs flawlessly with my vx9900 the sound is loud and of excellent quality and the controls are simple to operate i always use it in the car and it is easy to put on and take off the light weight makes it feel like it is not even on after some period of time the other 2 bluetooth headsets i owned were floppy on my ear and even this one looks flimsy but it fits snug on my ear my only complaint is the charger is difficult to plug into the phone i am going to buy a 2nd one for my wife because she also has an lg and needs it when using her phone in the car,181,0
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000NIAS7O,2.0,negative,volume does indeed get pretty high and in-ear type bud does work well in a car however i had to keep bending the ear hook to try to get a comfortable position ultimately after just a few months the ear hook metal fatigued and snapped rendering the device useless for those of you who might say well you idiot you should not have bent it i would reply that a little bit of plastic coating over the thin coat hanger type wire would have made the problem moot I have used numerous other bluetooth earpieces over the last several years and this is the first time I have come across one that actually snapped if i am to be complete here i should also add that the charger is quite finicky to connect however in a positive development it did not in fact break,141,1
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000NIAS7O,4.0,positive,contrary to the prior review i have found this to be a very good headset i have it paired with an lg cu500 phone and enjoy the features the first thing the prior reviewer needs to do is read the instructions as the button presses are not immediate responses holding the button for different amounts of time results in different actions which are accompanied by notifications through the in ear speaker the device is very small and compact with above average sound quality the in ear device loop is adjustable as the ear hook can be turned for use in the left or right ear and moved to the right or left for positioning it may just be my ear but it was not complicated at all and the only way it would fall out is if i had the hook positioned on the wrong side of the speaker also indicated in the instructions the only faults i really see are with the charging connection which is not clearly labeled as insert this side up so you have to fiddle with it to seat the charging connection overall it is one of the better devices i have used and i like it better than the jabra i had before as it is much easier to attach and weighs alot less,221,5
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000NIAS7O,3.0,neutral,the product did not come in packaging it was a gift and quite embarrasing to give a gift that way,20,14
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000NIAS7O,5.0,positive,i have been using this headset for about a month now and could not be happier great sound louder than i could ever need and people that i am talking to say that i am as well easy to use simple design minimal buttons comfortable i can leave it in my ear for hours on the road it is so light and really stays put bluetooth parnership is a breeze i have a cingular 8125 and i have not had a problem yet the only thing i could complain about is that the charger is a unique plug design so i have yet another cord to travel with,108,13
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000NIAS7O,4.0,positive,i like the size and light weight of this headset it has a thin wire around the ear so sunglasses can fit comfortably with it once i figured out how to use the power on and push button features i liked the convenience of using it also helps to read the instructions the volume and microphone also work very well,60,11
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000NIAS7O,3.0,neutral,this is the 4th bluetooth headset I have tried with my lg phone and it by far has the best reception it is also comfortable to wear the downside is that the button is not very user friendly I have had the device for a few weeks now and still have trouble turning that darn thing on and off as well as transferring calls the difference between all these operations is according to the manual whether you hold the button briefly for two seconds or for five seconds what has briefly there has no great blue / red lighting system on there to clearly indicate if the device is on off or charging,105,8
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000NIAS7O,1.0,negative,lg uses a proprietary connector for the charger i misplaced my charger and tried to replace it but i was not able to find a replacement charger with the correct connector i bought another headset instead motorola with a universal mini connector while the lg headset performed satisfactorily not perfectly by any means i would not recommend it because of the proprietary connector there are plenty of good headsets that use a universal connector allowing you to use many different chargers now i carry one plug-in and one car charger and use them for both my phone and headset anybody need an lg hbm 730 headset cheap charger not included [ footnote for some reason amazon has 3 separate listings for the lg hbm 730 ],125,9
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000NNZT1Y,4.0,positive,I have had this t-mobile smartphone for about two months now which i switched for my old razr i am overall satisfied with this phone but i constantly desire to switch back to my razr if i use it for anything other than calls for example music player or internet i find the battery being extremely low about two hours later for business people this could be inconvenient i personally find it frustrating the keys are almost too small for my fingers to type so i find myself erasing text quite often it is hard to keep in my pocket if i have a plastic cover on it if i just want to carry it with me it will slip out of my pocket if i have a third-party plastic cover but if you have just the phone the back is very good at keeping it in your pocket and purse i do love the music player especially since it is windows media player the battery will be depleted in about two hours so you do not have alot of listening time if you only charge your phone once a week the headphones that come with it are a plus meaning i do not have to buy a pair i also love the sound-it is crisp and pristine i love listening to my music on it if you are looking for a good business phone you might consider looking around first before buying this if you do buy it be sure you completely charge your phone before you go out if you just want a phone you can get a better price without all the extras i personally am pretty happy with this phone i think it is a top contender compared to the blackjacks,288,13
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000NNZT1Y,5.0,positive,i have had this for about 2 months now and i must say i am impressed so far i had verizon for 11 years and was a little hesitant to make the switch but after i did i have no regrets at all i have had no problems with service anywhere i go and my bill for the same services with verizon is less to boot i know verizon has the evdo network for data which is slightly faster the extra cost was not worth it to me at all i tether to my laptop all the time and the extra charge they wanted 15 a month seemed ridiculous to me for something i use an hour a day maybe two tops was something i was not willingpay also after rebates t-mobile piad me to get this phone against verizon where the best i was offered was something similar for 150 at the low end to 300 at the high end was a nice savings for me this phone is a great bang for the buck and is definitely worth a look if you are in the market for a smartphone,193,45
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000NNZT1Y,2.0,negative,i love the way the phone looks and feels but that is about it from finding contacts to dropped call this phone functions well below any phone I have ever owned I have had it now for 3 months and my frustration level continues to rise,43,47
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000NNZT1Y,4.0,positive,having previously owned a treo 650 nokia symbian phones and numerous pdas been pretty happy with this phone note i use it only for email / internet and not actually as a phone i upgraded from the treo 650 for a few reasons wifi outlook directpush found wifi to be not that big of a deal actually considered treo 750 but it was so much bulkier the design is decent wish the silver bezel was just black instead and the volume slider recess makes the product asymmetrical windows mobile 6 is aimprovement although wish it was more responsive at times but then again it is checking email on 4 accounts constantly outlook gmail yahoo and live not having a touch screen is actually helpful so do not have to worry about smudges on the screen camera and camera app sucks but that is expected battery life is not great but that is what you get for the thinness would purchase again,157,44
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000NNZT1Y,2.0,negative,i purchased the dash about 30 days ago and I am currently in the process of trying to return it for the blackberry curve 8320 instead let us start with the good things about the phone it looks great the rubbery back to the phone is nice and the phone itself is built well but the negatives are just so numerous the call volume at it is highest level is not really all that high on my morning commute i have to constantly ask the person on the other line to speak louder because i just can not hear anything out of it the battery life is also pretty poor while doing the normal text messaging occassional internet use and email I shall be lucky to get 6 to 8 hours on a full charge and finally there are known issues with the phone and software that will drive you mad like the alarm do not use it I have warned you every time you set an alarm it does not matter if you turn it off or set a new one the phone stores each and every alarm that you have ever set in the phone and executes them daily i currently have 5 alarms that go off each morning and there are only 2 solutions 1 pay up for a 3rd party app that will try to suppress the alarms or 2 reset the entire phone to it is factory settings and risk losing all of your stored data programs and contacts t-mobile htc and microsoft are all aware of the issue and there is no fix available from any of them so all in all it is just not worth it to me I am going to spend the extra 100 and try to get the blackberry curve instead,289,17
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000NNZT1Y,4.0,positive,okay get this left my phone on my desk in my room and left for an hour i had locked the door so nobody could have touched it came home and screen was cracked for no reason went to t-mobile store and it was my fault annd would cost me 110 stay away,53,27
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000NNZT1Y,2.0,negative,this phone is absolute garbage and adds re-enforcement to my theory that micrsoft puts out anything and do not care about quality control anymore these days problems I have had with the phone 1 my sim card erased everything and decided not to work anymore i had to go to a tmobile location to get a new one and all my contacts and info was gone 2 i can not access my text messages i have to restart the phone constantly 3 it is freezed on me about 10 times now and I have had the phone for 6 months 4 most obnoxious of all a few hours will go by and I shall think to myself weird my phone has not gone off and I shall make a call or text and my phone decides to just be shut off on it is own i mean the actual connection of the phone not the phone being turned off itself I am constantly turning it off / on and going to the comm manager to turn on the signal again update on this phone a year later battery life is near a minimum of two hours if you actually use this phone this phone fried my sim card and i lost everything i had to get another sim card phone still freezes more than it used to the profiles change on it is own and i had this phone go off on me in meetings funerals you name it the phone shuts off on me when I am in the middle of a website emails text message if i can change the 2 star to one i would but i can not so let me say it here do not buy this phone it is absolutely terrible worst phone I have ever had to deal with in my entire life one star,298,26
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000NNZT1Y,2.0,negative,i have had this t-mobile dash for about a year now and i am on my second one i cracked the screen on the first one by putting it in my pocket without the case i had to pay the whopping 110 that the insurance company uses as a deductible what a rip off that is probably what they pay for the phone wholesale i then had the next phone for about four months before the same thing happened i am not sure how it cracked this time but it did in my opinion they should not create a phone that can not handle a bit of pressure on it is screen before cracking i am very seriously thinking about dumping this phone because i can not afford to spend 110 every few months or so to have this phone do not get me wrong the smart phone functions are great the battery life is fine but too fragile,154,25
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000SZROBA,3.0,neutral,programmed in a foreign language and could not figure out how to make it work in english,17,0
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000SZROBA,1.0,negative,got this phone to replace one i have on att phone came in as t-mobile but that did not matter should still work did alright for about a month then boom the entire phone started going haywire ring tones backgrounds volume everything started going crazy had to pull out an old phone for the wife so she could receive calls and messages this is the first chance i have had to make a statement about the phone,75,1
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000SZROBA,5.0,positive,this phone is fantastic it takes care of all my needs phoning scheduling keeping track of people and data and more while traveling around the world it is sturdy and does not damage easily or initiate functions by accident easy to use and fun to use i love it and this is the second razr v3 that I have owned my only complaint is that it creates a completely different entry in the phone book for different phone numbers for the same contact my old razr v3 t kept them all in the same line,90,5
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000SZROBA,1.0,negative,i bought this phone because it looks like a nice phone i had big problems with the phone it did not work properly the phone would not hold a charge-the battery would die after making two phone calls unfortunately i had to return the phone and get my money back,50,15
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000SZROBA,3.0,neutral,this is our second razr v3 so we are already familiar with the features and i was happy to find the same model still available we occassionaly travel outside the us and this phone has worked great elsewhere in the world we got tired of jockeying sim cards so will leave one set for the us and the other will be our travel phone when we need it the phone arrived promptly but i orded black and got silver the box and instruction book were labled for a black phone and the cd had obviously been used envelope wrinkled cd scratched so i think the box may have been cheery-picked over time the phone itself seemed to be unused so we will keep it and do something ourselves to distinguish it from our other silver razr,135,11
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000SZROBA,4.0,positive,i have been a razr user for the past 3 years the new phone i received worked just as well as my previous one it was unlocked for sure it has worked with my sim card as soon as i put it in it has been the same case for my father in india as well after i gifted it to him he is quite happy with the phones functionality he was noticing that the batteries need charging every two to three days which apprently is unlike his previous phone a nokia i think that seems to be the only concern,101,14
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000SZROBA,1.0,negative,first of all i received an email telling me that the original silver one i ordered was not available would i accept a grey one instead these things happen so i said no problem the phone that arrived was not working the screen inside and out was dead i was given a return address and had to ship the thing back myself i can understand if i just did not want the phone but to eat the return shipping fees to return an obviously defectiveis something the seller needs to cover i feel completely used and will never do business with this company again this is the reason that i normally only deal with amazon shipping the gear as they will do the right thing and cover return shipping for defective merchandise too bad the same can not be said for this seller,143,8
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000SZROBA,1.0,negative,have used razrs in past with good luck but this one broke within 6 months and amazon would not replace it so i would not buy another phone from them again,31,13
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000UPBPUO,4.0,positive,this wireless bluetooth is exceptional for the cost the battery dies fast and i am having a difficult time finding this size battery aaaa in regular stores,25,9
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000UPBPUO,2.0,negative,spend the extra cash and buy a better one battery does not last for more than a couple calls,18,11
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000UPBPUO,5.0,positive,i purchased this from another store but it worked perfectly i could even talk across the room and it was comfortable wearing it for hours it could be worn on either ears and the hook could be molded to fit your ears curvature the only problem was that the hook broke overtime because of usage the headset still works,59,0
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000UPBPUO,4.0,positive,cheap and easy to pair was hoping that it was able to stream music over it but it can not be done,21,13
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000UPBPUO,3.0,neutral,it is a decent product but i rather have a bluetooth with a charger instead of having to continually replace the battery,22,5
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000UPBPUO,2.0,negative,not overly impressed with thispros cheap easy to connect to phone uses a regular 4a battery instead of a charger which i tend to misplace plus you do not hav to wait for it to charge if it is dead just pop in a new battery cons sound quality is low there is static on the line it is a bit heavy and awkward on the ear verdict wish i had just spent a bit more and gotten a nicer one,81,8
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000UPBPUO,3.0,neutral,this is not a bad little headset i picked it up cheap for use with my ps3 it pairs up easily and the sound quality is as good as any other headset I have used if i had to do it over again although i doubt i would buy this model for gaming there has no mute function which is not a must have but it is very convenient for coughing or answering a phone call the biggest downside is the aaaa battery aaaas pricey little buggers especially if you buy them in a retail store amazon sells a 6 pack for 6 that is the cheapest I have seen if you are looking for a ps3 headset you might want to have a look at the soon to be released socom headset it looks to be ideal for gaming as it should be,136,2
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000UPBPUO,5.0,positive,this headset is great it is small and easy to use will purchase again if ever needed i have small ears and this headset actually fits very comfortably and does not feel like it is going to fall out all of the time,42,1
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00113XA6G,4.0,positive,the case came in a good condition fit my cellphone perfectly the only bad thing was there was no protection for the screen overall the case is strong because i have dropped my cellphone a couple of times by accident and no scrash on the cellphone nor the case,49,0
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00113XA6G,3.0,neutral,i ordered 2 of these covers one for my phone and one for my sons one case fits perfectly the other is slightly warped and i feel it does not provide the protection it should i did not try to return the damaged case as the price was so small so i can not comment on customer service overall i am pleased with the product and would recommend it my friends,66,17
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00113XA6G,2.0,negative,after reading another persons review that it also covers the screen i ordered it mine does not cover my screen which is the reason i purchased it for me it was a waste of money,35,15
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00113XA6G,4.0,positive,this cover works great and keeps your phone from being scratched it stays on well it looks good the only issue is that to play the radio you have to ream out the slot with a knife so that the plug will go into the phone deep enough to work i do not like the plugin on the ericsson radio plug the rest of the slots are accesible thanks jr,69,1
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00113XA6G,4.0,positive,ok for the little price of this product lasted for a month and then sides were broken,17,8
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00113XA6G,5.0,positive,great product for the price was delivered in less than the specified time helps to keep your cell phone looking like new,22,5
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00113XA6G,3.0,neutral,this cover is to soft it will protect the phone from scratch but the plastic will brake because it to skinni is good for the price i guess another thing is that the whole phone is cover but there is only one part of the phone that stick out and everytime it fall guess what that part that is not cover is where it land and get scrath so yeah i recomend getting a better one although it does what is suppose to,82,11
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00113XA6G,4.0,positive,this is a pretty good product the only thing is i wish it had a cover for the screen but other than that it is easy to get on and off if need be and it does not look weird,39,3
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0014YJHNW,5.0,positive,i love this product it actually sticks if you use it right i bought it in the fall when it was cold and at first it would not stick for any length of time it would fall off at random times i had heard great things about this product and thought maybe it was a temperature-related problem when i tried it again in the spring it was somewhat better but it would still fall off eventually then i moved it from the side of the windshield to the center wow what a difference it has fallen once in the 4 months since but i might not have tightened it properly i think the side of my windshield is just too curved,120,50
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0014YJHNW,1.0,negative,do not buy this mount it does not work as advertised the suction cup fails to hold on either a windor or the dash disk that comes with it i struggled with it falling off for a few months and then finally threw it in the glove compartment never to be seen again,51,56
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0014YJHNW,1.0,negative,while this is clearly a well made product it only works without a case on your iphone for me that is a deal breaker i have no interest in taking my iphone in and out of a case each time i want to mount it in my car if you do not use a case then this is probably a great product if you use a case look elsewhere,69,0
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0014YJHNW,5.0,positive,i have an ipod 120 g and i bought this hoping that it would fit well as it turns out it does fit i am so impressed with this product because i drive a truck for a living i use the holder and an fm transmitter to keep me going when the radio gets too boring this product is put together solid the suction cup adheres to the window then you actually tighten the hold by twisting the base the other thing that i really liked about it was the fact that it does not shack my ipod i could actually watch a movie on it in the holder and not have a problem seeing it like i said i drive a 10 wheeler truck that shakes and rattles a lot over all i would recommend this product for anyone who might even think that it will hold their ipod,148,57
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0014YJHNW,3.0,neutral,like other reviews have said unless you have a windshield that is straight up and down like those in a box truck or jeep the angle will not allow you easy access to you phone it will be angled down towards you dash i mounted on my dash and it seems to work ok there i have a iphone 4s and it does not fit tight in the cradle but tight enough that the phone does not fall out even when going over bumpy gravel roads or around sharp turns my sons 3gs snaps into the cradle very tightly i had no issues with the suction cup working just wet the clear rubber part that connects to the window or disk and you will get a tight seal i will now be on the hunt for a replacement cradle that is made for the 4s this one did come with 3 different cradles for different phones just not one for a 4s or 5 i gave it 3 stars because it really does not work for a normal windshield i drive a dodge charger and the window slant is not all that much in my husbands toyota solara the phone basically faces downwards towards the dash his window slant is much greater than mine,214,5
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0014YJHNW,5.0,positive,the was a sweet holder i picked one up at wal-mart and i was surprised at how well it worked it come with a plastic disk that i stuck on to the inside of my slide-out cup-holder in my truck it worked perfectly unfortunately someone broke into my truck and stole it and my sub-woofers i never used my sub-woofers i was more upset about my iphone mount being stolen i could not find another one at wal-mart thank goodness for amazon,83,48
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0014YJHNW,2.0,negative,while thisis reasonably priced i found it difficult to get a proper viewing angle when it was affixed to the windshield i was not able to move the various joints so that i could easily see the unit while driving i ended up removing one whole section which was a bit of a challenge it now is usable but far short of ideal one unexpected positive was the inclusion of a cable to connect the iphone to the stereo not sure why it was included but when i replaced my cd player in my car they were going to charge me 30 for the same cable,108,16
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0014YJHNW,4.0,positive,i bought this fully thinking it was going to be mediocre at best but it turned out to work very well i use it 5 days a week in the ambulance and it has not fallen off one time i did have trouble like others mounting it the first time but if you read the instructions it mounts solid i actually have it mounted to the door glass in front of the a / c vent as the windshield is too hot here in phoenix and it still has not come off even with slamming the door 50x a day on top of running a heavy truck all over town 60 hours a week it did not have a hole for the camera but i drilled one with no problem the only drawback is it is limited angle of viewing you can not make it turn 90 degrees toward you from the side window it sits about 70 degrees and is fine i can still see the map easily and read any text or email without problem the power cord fits perfectly and so does the headphone cord so long story short after a few months of use it was 10 well spent,200,12
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0016I6GUS,4.0,positive,sound quality is better than i expected they really do a great job with that they are a little on the uncomfortable side right above your ear but it is nothing that i can not bare and i do have a big head i need them to hug my ear tightly when working out so anything less and i may have a problem with them falling out I am almost positive that a little black foam there would do wonders overall I am happy with them and would recommend them to anyone that is familiar with behind the head earphones,96,76
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0016I6GUS,4.0,positive,sound quality great a little tight on the ears no ajustments easy to operate great for the gym i would recommend,21,0
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0016I6GUS,2.0,negative,i purchased these samsungs because they seemed like they would be the best value bluetooth headphones i generally like samsung products so i thought I had give them a chance first of all they sent me a pair in all black they were not blue like the picture that made me mad i do not necessarily dislike black but the blue touches were part of what excited me about the product design the audio quality was pretty good they got pretty loud and they stayed pretty clear sometimes the audio would do this time warp thing where the music would speed up or slow down a little bit I am pretty sure that was the fault of my iphone although not the headphones the charging port has pros and cons i like that it had a little door over it to keep it from getting dirty but it is a proprietary connector which was annoying the final blow for these headphones was the fit I had read reviews saying that they were painful and dang they sure are painful at first i figured people were just being big babies and that they would loosen up over time or at least i would get used to them nothese things slice into the side of your head sometimes they would almost bring me to tears and i have an incredibly high pain threshold if i do say so myself all that to say that i ended up returning them i replaced them with a pair of the motorola s9 hd headphones they are about twice the price but worth every dime attractive design usb charging great audio and still less than 70 I am much happier with the motorolas,279,26
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0016I6GUS,1.0,negative,i bought this unit earlier this year and having been using using it since then good from an acoutic perspective but extremely flimsy from a construction perspective it is made of cheap plastic and it breaks far too easyily i am in the market for a replacement unit since mine broke last week,53,22
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0016I6GUS,2.0,negative,let me just say that i have owned 3 yes 3 pair of these and always the same result the cheap plastic that holds these together the head band has broken so unless you are getting a great deal do not waste your money the only reason i gave them 2 stars was for there sound and ease of use,58,12
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0016I6GUS,5.0,positive,the product was accurately described and the shipping was lightning fast this seller is highly recommended,16,67
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0016I6GUS,5.0,positive,i love these head phone and I am happy that samsung and amazon keep on stock because i m on my 5th pair because i keep breaking them not because a design flaw my carelessness on how i remove them from my ears and me sleeping in them so do not be alarm these are some great head phone i mean i replace with no problem 4x alright that how good they are i used them on my galaxy s i ii and iii my ps3 and vita and many ipod and mp3 devices so i know they are great tryem thanks always amazon,93,10
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0016I6GUS,5.0,positive,this headset has very good sound quality works well with apple ipod touch ios 42 required for full functionality very durable and well suited for use during exercise comfort for people with glasses could be a bit better however,39,18
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00188ZOEU,4.0,positive,i like the way this works but it is a bit bulky and hard to open i think thinner leather a smaller clip and an easier flap would improve things but it is still good,33,0
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00188ZOEU,3.0,neutral,the case seems well made but the little things are either not thought through or not manufactured to spec the fit overall is reasonably snug but since the bezel on the note is so thin there is precious little non-screen real estate on the sides and the case could have benefited from more stiffness in that area as it is it just bulges to the left and right the bottom strip also bulges in the middle the microphone on the note is a small hole on the bottom of the casing the case has a round piece punched out for it but it is not quite centered on the hole you have to wiggle the phone and/or stretch the leather from time to time to keep it open on the other hand the cutout around the usb / charger connector is huge at least three times it is width there is no i repeat no way to connect the earpiece or headphones to the top jack when the flap is closed apparently designers did not expect note owners to listen to music or the radio while the phone is in their pocket or to have a long conversation hands-free nothing that 5 minutes with an x-acto will not fix of course also this concerns only the vendor not the product prime members should not put their trust in the two-day shipping i ordered theon friday night received a shipping estimate for wednesday and it finally arrived on thursday six days can not count as two under any definition of the term,257,1
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00188ZOEU,5.0,positive,this case is a perfect fit for the galaxy note it is extremely attractive functional and protective I have already dropped it and it withstood the test excellent product i like the vertical flap because it comes with a removable clip the clip is handy but is easily removed so the case fits nicely in your pocket excellent product,58,5
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00188ZOEU,3.0,neutral,you have to be kidding me thisis at best a 2 to 3 star product it is not high grade in any way but really when you have a product as large as the note and are thinking about attaching it to your belt you should be shot anyway fashion disaster,52,15
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00188ZOEU,1.0,negative,initially looks excellent after five weeks clip started getting loose after eleven weeks clips got broken while getting into car needs to have a better clip for 30 i would not buy similar product unless has a decent return policy,42,11
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00188ZOEU,2.0,negative,unfortunately i can not use this case because i can not use my phones volume rocker whenever I am on a call it is very annoying that i have to take the phone completely out of the case whenever i need to make or receive a call this is not to say that there has no opening in the case for the volume rocker in fact there is an opening for the volume rocker the problem is that the opening is not big enough and/or it is not properly aligned so whenever i try to use the volume rocker it simply does not work because the case is always in the way very annoying,105,14
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00188ZOEU,4.0,positive,i found the case to be very well constructed and it looks great the case is well padded but the phone in the case is still very thin and close fitting the only two things i would change is first have an opening for the headphones to plug into and second the opening for the volume on the left side will never line up properly and it always is a bother but i never give up so the simple fix was i removed my phone pushed the top of the leather opening up and inward putting a small amount of super glue in the crease and it is out of the way it does not effect the looks at all and it is easy to use the volume rocker button i found all of the other openings lined up perfectly please remember that with all leather cases you must seat the phone properly in the case this could be corrected at the factory but i do love the case i ordered this from amazoncom by next day delivery and as always i received it the next afternoon this is why i use amazoncom so often they always deliver as they promise and everything is well packed and in perfect condition,210,8
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00188ZOEU,3.0,neutral,i purchased thisbased on the excellent review i read on amazon i used it for maybe a week and i noticed that the clip would not keep it in place especially when in the car and getting out it dropped a couple of times inside of the car but when i got out of the car one day and dropped on the asphalt i realized that it does not fully protect the phone from the bottom the other thing with it is a described by others that you can not use a corded earphone to listen to music or to talk becuase the way the flap on the case is it will not allow you you would have to keep the flap open then it would not serve it is purpose,127,13
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0018OKDNG,5.0,positive,my husband is really enjoying the phone it is great I am actually thinking about getting one myself but my main concern is that with this order there was a cd that i did not want and ordered by accident i have returned theand i have not heard anything or have not been refunded can you please send me something in regards to this matter thanks tina bailey,68,75
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0018OKDNG,3.0,neutral,i bought the lg vu to replace my sony w810i and returned it the phone is very attractive although i expected the quality of the materials to be better the touch screen works well and the landscape qwerty keyboard is great for text messages call quality is good and the speakerphone is loud five problems although 1 the screen is barely visable in the sun 2 the camera is better than most phones at 2mp and auto focus but there is no flash and the sonys 2mp camera took better pictures 3 I am on a mac and i do not want an iphone because of the monthly service plan cost but the lg vu does not sync with my mac and the sony did 4 it does not work as well with my acuras handsfreelink in car bluetooth it does not show the battery life or signal strength 5 the contacts does not provide a space for birthdays or addresses if these issues do not matter to you then I am sure you will like the phone i however was trying to upgrade phones and a touch screen does not a great phone make ps sorry i can not comment on battery life or be more in depth but i only had the phone for a day before i returned it i purchased an unlocked nokia n82 a few weeks later and that phone is far superior although the price is high,237,0
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0018OKDNG,3.0,neutral,purchased this phone for my wife but it does not work well with the handsfree system in her lexus she can make calls but the phone will not ring through the vehicles audio system display signal strength or battery level on the cars display i looked on the lexus web site and it looks like none of the lg phones will ring through the vehicles audio system she rarely can hear it ring when she is driving the only way she knows a call is coming in is the cars display changes from map to phone other issue is the address book on the phone if you have more than one phone number for a contact it is difficult to get to the screen that allows you to select which number you want to call we have a few days left to take it back and i think we will,150,70
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0018OKDNG,2.0,negative,i had this phone since sept08 to march09 initially i liked this phone very much since it had att live tv but that is the only selling point of this phone the touchscreen is resistive and most of the time one has to tap more than one time to use the feature and being resistive screen it has overall dark contrast coming to battery life it is very very bad i mean very very bad att tv finishes battery so fast that one can not imagine if one is using headsets to watch att tv then one can not charge the phone since both charger and headset uses proprietary port of lg music is of worst quality one can only use lg headset since it has proprietary port and the music quality is very bad and sound is way too low no wifi is also a big time disappointment one has to depend on att medianet to use internet on the phone plus no gps also dampens the use of this phone i paid 17999 before 50 rebate with contract extension and i feel totally disappointed ebay-ed this phone for 160 and bought a new nokia n85 which is 1000 times better than this touchscreen phone positive reviews you might have already read it and if you have never experienced touchscreen before you might like it too but my suggestion is to go to a store and try it and try other touchscreen phones too before ordering it online,245,22
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0018OKDNG,1.0,negative,yes this phone has some excellent features that would be why i selected it about 10 months ago unfortunately my contract / warranty leaves me stuck with this lemon i am yet again using a disposable phone while i wait for them to replace my lg again I am not hard on phones i do not swim with them i do not play handball with it i do not play extreme sports with it in my pocket it is usually either in the recharging station sitting on my desk or in the cell phone pocket of my bag it just stops working out of the clear blue every lg vu cu920 i get loses the touch screen capability within weeks or months i can answer calls because that is a mechanical function but otherwise it becomes a paper weight the instant i become eligible for a different phone i will be changing brands and getting a phone without a touch screen nice concept execution not so much,165,12
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0018OKDNG,3.0,neutral,just got this little lg and here are my thoughts very clear voice calls great speaker and the people on the other end can not tell I am on the speaker while i am driving the touch screen is really bright and pictures show great getting used to the touch screen but the feedback feature is really handy for me reception so far has been great only one lost call in an area that i know is a deadspot did not think I had care for the tv feature but it is very cool and great for killing time at airports and while visiting my mom who does not have a tv in the spare rooms the screen is really sharp and the picture really shows well even if a bit small like i said so far so good the only negatives are the world time does not adjust automatically when i reach a foreign country and as a result i can not use the phone as my alarm clock abroad that is a very useful feature on a lot of phones i also can not use my recordings from my music downloads or voice recordings as my ringtones and last but not least is that there is no flash on the camera but i knew that before i got the phone overall i am very satisfied with it as a phone which is why i need it all the extra stuff to me is just that extra this may keep me as an at t customer,245,56
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0018OKDNG,3.0,neutral,briefly you can get on the internet and get your email reception is ok but this is not a high quality phone the touch screen is temperamental with a lot of unintended results and missed inputs the bluetooth works well although and battery life is ok overall i would not buy another one,53,10
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0018OKDNG,3.0,neutral,i agree with the others about the responsiveness of the touch screen and the volume very good i use an old-school plantronics headset with it and it only drops the signal on occasion that being said here are a few caveats that are not really dealbreakers but they can be irritating after a while 1 if you dial voice mail right after a missed call the voice mail number replaces that number on the call list it looks like you can call them right back by using the touch screen but in fact it dials voice mail instead if the number is not elsewhere on your phone this can be inconvenient while driving for example 2 if you want to return to the mute screen after dialing into a conference call you have to backspace thru the numbers you keyed in 3 there is not a conference call feature to add someone to the conversation if someone else calls you on the other line 4 you can not set the alarm while the phone is silent if you do not want to be awakened by phone calls the vu is still a nice low-cost alternative to the iphone if you do not need all the bells and whistles but my next touch screen phone will have at least one of these issues remedied,219,18
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001AVXON8,3.0,neutral,there seems a problem with the battery the talk and stanby time become less and less it is annoying to charge the headset frequentyly,23,55
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001AVXON8,2.0,negative,the headset worked well for the first two-three months then increasingly it started to drop out there is a silence and i realize that i have to pick up the handset to continue the conversation so the phone call was not dropped just the transmission to the device it seems like the battery may be the problem after it has turned off once or twice in a row it just will not start again until i have charged it again,79,40
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001AVXON8,5.0,positive,great sellerarrived on time and was is good condition i had a jaw bone before purchasing this one i think this one was actually an older model it did not last as long as my old one did i liked the gold,45,19
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001AVXON8,5.0,positive,I have had a motorola clip-on [ visor ] but it always was losing the bluetooth pairing it is a pain to repair the jawbone is so simple to pair with my iphone 4 i could not believe it it is a pleasure to use my only concern is to get it to fit around my ear well although i have not tried too much yet to adjust it the simple touch to turn on is great bill,72,31
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001AVXON8,5.0,positive,this headset performs much better than expected i have bought many bluetooth headsets with the goals of finding one that stayed paired to phone had clear sound had excellent range between phone and headset was comfortable on ear and provided noice cancelling features this tops out all categories pairing with the iphone 3 g was a breeze i can even talk with the windows down while driving on the freeway,69,115
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001AVXON8,3.0,neutral,I have read a lot of reviews before buying but i have to repeat almost everything i say,17,56
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001AVXON8,1.0,negative,i have two identical jawbones and neither have batteries that last any more than four hours,16,69
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001AVXON8,4.0,positive,this bluetooth is comfortable to wear and gives over 3 hours of continuous talk time on a full charge it also recharges in approximately 10 - 15 minutes the gold jawbone looks almost like a piece of jewelry i think the noise reduction technology is over rated the new sound id300 has a longer talk time and is as comfortable but does not charge as quickly,64,105
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001B1RT10,2.0,negative,I have had this product for about 4 months now and while i have enjoyed being able to jog with my iphone my arm regularly falls asleep because of the flimsy armband and unless i have my headphones cord at the perfect length both the phone and headphone cord retainer easily come off the band if i need to make an adjustment while jogging while this is an inexpensive armband i would not buy it again,74,39
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001B1RT10,1.0,negative,i was sorely tempted to produce a video review instead to show the complete failure of this product but figured it would waste more time than it took me to shop for it if you take the armband and put it on it feels fairly secure add an iphone 3gs and very quickly you realize what a waste of money this would be it flops up and down and the arm band wiggles it is way down your arm unless you have it tight enough to constrict the blood flow at which point you are at risk of fainting during exercise i had the nike neoprene armband for my nano when i used the old sport kit and the velcro fastener and neoprene combo made it easy to wrap firmly around your arm partially waterproofing the nano but also securing it completely I am going to have to try to find one like that for the 3gs in person at a store since I have unfortunately ditched the packaging and can not return this hunk o junk,173,25
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001B1RT10,2.0,negative,pros this is a very attractive sportband it has slot of neat features such as the snap clip for the armband that will male it easy to loosen and tighten the armband on demand it also has the cable wrap for your headphone so it will not get into the way while exercising cons the iphone 3gs simply will not fit into the pouch it is way too tight and appears to have not been designed correctly for instance there is a small whole where the earpiece of the phone is suppose to line up but regardless of how hard i pushed the iphone down it will not go any further leaving the top of the phone exposed and earpiece unalligned also around hole where the iphone goes in there has a thin strip of what appears to be paper that is glued around the mouth is located the paper broke the moment you stretch the hole slightly to insert the iphone very poor quality and design no wonder it is getting cheaper by the day highly not recommend it,175,26
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001B1RT10,4.0,positive,overall it is a good product buttons are easily accessible only problem was when i am running the band will slide down from my arm even after tigthening it up it was very distracting that i have to stop running and taking my iphone out of the case and hold it in my hand while running,55,44
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001B1RT10,4.0,positive,the armbands fast-dry material works well the ability to pull off the iphone and use the holder as a belt-clip is also very handy i love this thing so much that i just bought a second one after i had left my first one at the gym and someone took it home thankfully my iphone was not in it i also love the clip feature instead of the velcro what others use it allows for armband adjustment ahead of time and the clip seems to keep the armband snugly around the arm there are two reasons why i did not give it 5 stars 1 the phone holding pocket jumps around a bit while running and bouncing since it is not snugly attached to the armband but uses the belt clip instead however after about 6 months of use it never has fallen out it is ust a minor annoyance 2 the iphone touchscreen can sometimes be slightly unresponsive through the plastic but I have only noticed that when my hands are very sweaty or wet however most of the time while I am working out i do not really need to mess with the screen since i either use pandora or have a playlist preset,199,35
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001B1RT10,3.0,neutral,nick look but hard to access controls through window the case like access for charge cable and camera,18,41
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001B1RT10,4.0,positive,i bought this for around 10 shipped and i have to say it was definitely worth the price my iphone is secure in the fitted pocket so it does not rattle around when i run the armband length is pretty long so it can be adjusted for various different sizes yes i do wish that the screen was a little bit more accessible but it really does not bother me that much i listen to my songs on a playlist so i do not touch the iphone at all but when you get a phone call it is near impossible to answer sliding the bar to unlock the iphone is ridiculously hard and even if you can do that the mic is totally muffled because there has no holes for it again i do not talk on the phone while runnning but in that rare instance when you really want to take a call to say I shall call you right back then you are out of luck son,161,4
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001B1RT10,3.0,neutral,i bought this sport armband with the intention of using it to run first of all i am 5 foot and the band is so freaking tight on my arm i am not a huge fatty so i can not imagine how other people manage to use this unlike someone elses review to my surprise mine does have velcro so I am not sure who was sent a different model anyway it seems alright for now a little cheesy in construction but you get what you pay for others are 30 the plastic is glued not stitched but it seems to be alright for now it stays put while i run unlike another review i read,113,12
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL8PLW,2.0,negative,the concept is nice the price is right but this product is not worth the effort followed directions to the letter and still to many air bubbles after several tries took film off put it back in it is packaging and threw it the trunk of my car probably to never use again besides the iphone screen is made of glass so it cleans up easy one or two wipes with a micro cloth and you are good to go,80,0
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL8PLW,3.0,neutral,I have only used one film from the pack and it is lasted one year it is an okay product but it is not a smudge-free film,24,1
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL8PLW,3.0,neutral,this product comes in a very nice package and everything is very luxury however the back coating on the screen protecter when u go to apply it is very difficult to come off and it is almost immpossable to get all the air bubbles out and like some of the other reviews said it sort of ruins the amazing resolution of the screen again it is what it says smudge free i would be more satisfied if it did some with maybe 2 screen protectors instead of 1 next time i am going to try the power support crystal film set which comes with 3 and i have a friend who has it and loves it,116,8
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL8PLW,4.0,positive,a good and very cheap anti-glare screen protector installation was easy and the cutouts were precise enough to stay away from the home button and the earpiece very little if any fingerprints show up and makes the screen readable under direct light now when i take the train the sun does not bother me the film does blur and lower the brightness of the screen a bit but that comes with all antiglare overall a good purchase for those that want to try anti-glare and not pay a premium at the apple store,92,5
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL8PLW,5.0,positive,i was so so so pleased with this product went on in 2 seconds with no bubbles microfiber cleaner cloth worked great too had originally bought the screen covers from apple store impossible to apply without bubbles i was blown away by the ease of application with this product i bought the ones for my iphone and hubbys lg vu i recommend,62,3
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL8PLW,1.0,negative,i would not recommend this product it creates tons of bubbles it is not smudge free waste of money get the actual apple one which is bubble / smudge free,27,13
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL8PLW,5.0,positive,service is excellent got my product in very good condition and this product is a must have for iphone users not only it looks good on it but it protects and makes your phone looking brand new,37,16
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL8PLW,4.0,positive,i like this screen cover i bought this for my iphone 1st gen and it worked fine however i had to trim the sides a little bit i did not think iphone 3g/3gs had wider screen than the 1st gen i guess it is a little bit anyway if you want to buy this for your 1st gen iphone be advised that this is a little wider for it other than that it is perfect,74,15
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001QFZKN0,1.0,negative,the elegant design metallic case quality display overall operability of the phones standard communications and convenience features and even an amazingly clear built-in speaker should please any user not inclined toward heavy text-messaging or web-surfing and all of this pleased me until my phone stopped working after 2 months instead of starting up it just began flashing a white screen for a few seconds got a replacement and 2 months later that phone died an identical death ordered a new replacement as this was mandatory given my mobile service agreement and in 2 more months I shall get back with you getting back with you phone just broke again same problem although this time it lasted an amazing 4 months worse news is t-mobile is forcing me to take a fourth one before i can upgrade to something that may actually endure for awhile my fifth replacement phone is on the way can not wait,152,0
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001QFZKN0,1.0,negative,the sierra wireless card is flimsy and has defects there is some glitch that when it updates it is software it kills the wireless unit I have had 4 of these replaced now the biggest rip off of all is that sprint warehouse says it is does nt receive them back and sprint charges you 100 after 15 days this time i mailed it back with postal certification to prove it was received by them sprint customer service says they acknowledge there has a problem but they have to just send the information higher into their management chain i also had a sprint lotus phone widely known for being defective and yet sprint still sells them to this day sprint has ripped me off bottom line I am posting this as a warning to others avoid sprint,131,1
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001QFZKN0,4.0,positive,i rather like this phone the internal screen is very impressive however the phones reception is not that good I have tested 2 different t-mobile phones in the same area and this phone has the worse reception the phone is very good-looking it does not look durable although the keys do not feel comfortable if you text a lot they are not very responsive so you can not type very fast,67,5
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001QFZKN0,5.0,positive,so I am the type of person who really takes care before making a purchase such as a cell phone because i intend to own it until it is no longer workable however i bought this phone back in november on a bit of a whim because my old cell phone which endured for more than three years had finally broken to the point of no return and i love it it is modern easy to use five-fave compatible and offers a lot more space for storing pictures and music than my previous phone the camera takes nice pictures the sound is good if you are looking to hear a little music and your ipod is dead and there are really cool pre-set themes you can choose from my only contention is that the flip action is not especially smooth but I am used to the slider phone i had for three years before this happy cell phone hunting,154,15
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001QFZKN0,2.0,negative,i have had mobile broadband through sprint for three years it was finally time to get a new modem and i chose this one i am sorry i did it gets no reception inside or outside of my house this little modem is getting sent back to sprint as soon as possible,49,11
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001QFZKN0,5.0,positive,i do not know what the previous reviewers expectations are but the device will only work as well as the service connection for your area i live in an area where we had only dial up or satellite for internet available to us until this and let me tell you the blazing speeds i get with this comparatively make it well worth it to me in a rural area i think within about a mile of the tower i get consistently 2 mb coverage it works perfectly runs probably easily 12 hours / day and I have had it for 10 months the only time it has gone down everything in my area is down including landline and cell phones actually that happened a couple days before thanksgiving everything was down but my sierra wireless was still delivering dial up speed connection,142,14
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001QFZKN0,5.0,positive,perfect product high quality can not go wrong with this product as i have used it for 2 years and have had no problems,21,8
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001QFZKN0,4.0,positive,i have this card and it works ok the service where i am in tucson gives me about 40 to 60 percent i did buy a antennae from [ ] and it works awesome with this card it is a booster antenna w / cables for sierra aircard 598u i get 80 100 percent with the antenna plugged in,56,13
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001TL0Z72,4.0,positive,phone is a very good a bit heavy but makes up for it is speed and keyboard very adaptable to large fingers very good buy maybe buy one for a friend,30,9
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001TL0Z72,3.0,neutral,i read all of the reviews and even checked online to make sure this was a good phone it is not a smart phone it is the most stupid phone I have ever owned and i intend to return it as soon as possible it took 3 days of searching online to find out how to download ringtones to the phone that the phone will actually let me use nothing in the manual or the online manual tells you the hoops you have to jump thru if there had not been a blog I had have never figured it out this phone shuts off immeditately if i turn it on and accidentally turn my hand sideways while holding it it will not get at t service at my house even although my at t go phone gets a signal without a problem it will not hook to the 3 g network half the time i bought this phone new so it was not remanufactured do not waste your time or money,159,11
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001TL0Z72,1.0,negative,i bought an htc tilt 2 when replacing a blackberry bold 9000 end of contract / changing to a new phone it was the flavor of choice and had a number of things i wanted i had it for three weeks of the time all the windows features worked fine did not have difficulty with freezes or other things that people reported i set up my email and it failed numerous times would not automatically send / receive without going thru hoops anything sent was visible for 1and anything received was also visible for 1there was no auto-delete function invoked i was on the phone with at t for 6 hrs over the course of the last two weeks they agreed there was a problem i took it into an at t store where their store management reproduced the problems down to the last one and said he agreed too lacking the email function this smart phone is not such a smart phone and not worth the box it came in i replaced it paying the difference in with a blackberry torch I have now had it 3 weeks the torch and have had zero problems and have not had a need to call tech support not even once one other thing that should be changed the keys and the backlighting make for difficult use of the keys unless the room is dim keyor backlightshould be changed good luck with your purchase or find something else,251,0
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001TL0Z72,5.0,positive,wifi and navigation is supergood htc is a classic smartphone that greatly combines a real smart phone and a pc personalized it to my style and proud of my choice,30,13
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001TL0Z72,5.0,positive,i had one just like this before someone robbed me so i know what i was buying yeah this is not an iphone or a new phone with android but with a few hints you can make of this old smartphone it was released in 2007 works pretty damm well i install the windows mobile 65 and the performance of the phone improves a lot much faster without freezes I have installed a cooked version of the phoenix iii with touchflo i have the newest opera mobile garmin xt foursquare youtube and the performance is quite well the battery life is acceptable using wifi or the 3 g networks 1 day fully charged I am from chile and the purchase and shipping were faster and without problems,124,5
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001TL0Z72,2.0,negative,I have had and loved other htc phones this one does not live up to it is brand at all i bought two for my girls this past christmas and they have had nothing but problems despite being long time cell phone users part of the problem is the crappy windows software but even if that was not a pita the hardware is already falling apart and it is just mid-january the tilt feature broke the first week in one of them i bought extra batteries for them and it is a good thing because the battery life is almost non-existent also they are very bulky so if you want a fairly light or small phone this is not it,115,8
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001TL0Z72,4.0,positive,as the title suggests i consider this smartphone to be a good work horse a previous poster listed a few features on this device I have expanded some of the detail on that and added some other info tether as a modem very helpful and less expensive than buying a standalone aircard full keyboard there is a soft keyboard you can type on without having to slide out the keyboard everytime you need to type something can open edit save microsoft office files word powerpointon an iphone you can only view not edit screen tilts helpful to reduce glare create ringtones on the fly by choosing a song and right clicking without additional cost helpful tips for windows mobile periodically windows mobile devices experience registry corruption the best resolution is to perform a hard reset on the device clearing out the memory and essentially freshly building the device by doing these periodic resets in my experience 2 times a year is necessary the device remains responsive and less buggy there is a lot of functionality built into the tilt that is handy it is one of the better windows devices for navigation using a bluetooth gps bug the device can do quite well guiding without the necessity of having to buy a singletasking handheld navigation system,226,2
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001TL0Z72,5.0,positive,this is a really good device i have had many cellphones and pdas and this is one of the best ones i have ever had it is durable has good battery life and an easy to use qwerty keyboard the tilting action makes it easy to see what you are typing with no glare the video resolution is good and sd card makes it as expandable as you want you can switch out cards if you start running out of room or want to keep some files private i highly recommend this device i have used it in a busy medical practice loaded with references and resources and with the google mobile apps bar i am on the internet in a flash and can access the web or my google apps luckily it is pretty much drop proof,138,1
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,1.0,negative,this kit is terrible in a 2004 escalade the radio did not clear the bottom and sits about an 8th inch out,21,55
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,1.0,negative,just like any dash kit from walmart this is terrible quality breaking the tabs i needed to to make it fit the holes was very hard but breaking the ones i needed to keep by accident was all too easy i do not recommend this or sosche,46,40
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,2.0,negative,the side plates probably would have worked if the tabs i need had not broke while trying to cut off the tabs that are not needed as directed by the instructions one had no room around it for using a razor blade knife it was the last tab i had to do and a few needed tabs were very close to it that they ended up being broken off i am not sure how i could have been more careful,78,19
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,1.0,negative,extremely cheap i have installed many stereos and this broke within two days,13,31

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,4.0,positive,worked as described wish there was not as much cutting of tabs involved,13,105
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002959MS0,2.0,negative,i was thrilled with theof a regular keyboard against touch keyboard on my iphone it is a more comfortable way to type for me the addition of the keyboard adds a little bulk to the phone but is very comfortable and lower profile than the one my friend has from a year ago the problem i have with this product is that i have only been using it for 6 weeks and already the markings on the keyboard have rubbed off so now i can not see the functions of many of the keys it does not matter much on the letters but the symbols are gone and i have to guess and hunt for the right ones now not acceptable wear,122,27
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002959MS0,1.0,negative,thisis not worth the 60 dollars it costs i was hoping to have an easier time typing however with most of the applications it does not turn it also drains you battery i had to charge my phone 5 to 6 times a day very unhappy sending theback,52,40
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002959MS0,2.0,negative,not worth it wanted my new iphone to work as my old htc evo shift but it did not to bulky and i do not like the full touch screen very much i i phone is not all that bad,38,26
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002959MS0,3.0,neutral,if you are looking for a case with the slide out keyboard this is as good as it gets for now the case and keyboard are a bit bulky but they get the job done i find myself taking the case off when I am at work and only using it when at home,53,43
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002959MS0,3.0,neutral,this case / keyboard works just fine everything functions well my only complaint is that it is difficult to hold / balance as the top where the phone is is so much heavier than where the keyboard is makes it uncomfortable to hold while typing functionality is fine i do not know how one would redesign this to fix this i have become accustomed to using siri so i do not have to type at all,71,24
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002959MS0,4.0,positive,i love the case i got it yesterday and i there is nothing really about it that i do not like i just got to get used to where the keys are but the only flaw about it is my keyboard seems a little loose but besides that it is a great case and i would recomend it to everyone who wants a physical keyboard to use plus the backlite is very usefull in dark areas,73,37
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002959MS0,5.0,positive,this keyboard was probably the best purchase for my iphone that I have ever made it worked wonderfully and the keyboard was just the right size for me i will say that if you have bigger fingers then this product might not be for you but it never wore out and i type a lot of texts messages during the day the backlighting worked great as well the only thing that was tricky was knowing when to plug the keyboard in to charge but it did last me about 2 - 3 days and that is with it constantly being on and used very impressed and happy with this product even although i do not have that phone anymore,114,12
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002959MS0,4.0,positive,the virtual keyboard keys are a little to small for me and my smart phone makes me feel a little dumb you know always spelling a word before you can finish your sentence spell check is good and sometimes i need it but not with ever word the keyboard buddy allows me to text with ease it makes the phone a little thick i can live with that just what i needed,72,19
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0029F2O3A,5.0,positive,great phone which has the comfort of a larger phone mixed with a very easy to use qwerty keyboard the keyboard has nice space and a texture that feels like the kindle with the touch of a button the qwerty turns into 1234 or ect just a need phone highly recommended,52,0
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0029F2O3A,3.0,neutral,the messaging features are nice typing text messages is not so much of a hassle with the keyboard also the screen is quite pretty i have found the morphing keyboard to be a great feature when receiving calls the phone works over half the time but it sometimes resets when i attempt to answer calls also at other times it lights up when a call is coming in but will not actually finish the process and start ringing so i do not know who actually called until they tell me later I am beginning to kick myself for signing a contract for service with this phone and i suspect that it is going to be a pain in the butt until the contract is up,122,1
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0029F2O3A,5.0,positive,this is a excellent phone great talk time excellent standby very user friendly i may state it takes a little time to get use to but so does it when you change to new anything the only down fall is the top 3 keys when your texting when you have large fingers besides that i would recommend this phone to anybody my wife and kids go through phones like water so had many phones but this one is very unique exspecially with the flip screen the pictures are excellent minus not having a flash i can live with that because in low light still takes excellent pics the flashes on all other phones are a joke those are only good for a couple of foot so take how you want but i recommend this phone for anybody men or women is is very unique only gripe is for my wife could be in different colors but my gripe is 3 top buttons could be different thanks for reading jeff,169,5
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0029F2O3A,5.0,positive,i just got this phone a couple days ago and i am in love it works great texting is a breeze great size,23,15
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0029F2O3A,4.0,positive,i have been using this phone for a few days now and i like it i am not a big gadget phone fan preferring a simpler device that does just what i want the voice quality is acceptable and after a short learning cycle is easy to use the alias 2 allows me a novice texter to send and receive text messages with no real hassles the keypad is a great size even for my larger fingers i would have given 5 stars except for the learning curve required to figure the phone out not that this is bad but it is definitely different than the older phones i was used to,112,11
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0029F2O3A,1.0,negative,this is probably the wrost experience i had with amazon and it costed me 7200 both my phones from amazon arrived inright time but without activation i called at t and they could not locate our phone numbers so had to call back amazon and learned that they have not activated our phones amazon customer service took good amount of time to do this meanwhile i missed by billing cycle with old cell phone company this process took about a week and not to mention the sim card delivered was not working and amazon had to ship again,97,14
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0029F2O3A,2.0,negative,overall i like the phone for it is call quality i love the keyboard and find it very easy to type text messages i have not used the camera or the bluetooth features i can access my email accounts easily the main problem with the phone is that locks up when i attempt to use the mp3 player i have an 8 gb microsd card with all of my music on it i hook the phone up to my car radio to play it everything was fine for the first month but now the phone locks up or freezes when it is in media mode and the only way to unlock it is to remove and then replace the battery very annoying the phone has also turned off several times when i was attempting to answer a call,134,8
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0029F2O3A,2.0,negative,i loved my samsung alias as most alias owners do i decided to purchase the alias 2 on faith assuming that samsung had simply updated certain features of the original i was mistaken the first thing you will notice is the size the alias 2 is taller thicker and wider than the original if you are like me one of the reasons you bought the original alias was it is super-slim design i would say it is about 50 bulkier than the original while the original slid into your jeans and disappeared the new one will stick out like a sore thumb i suppose the increase in size supports the new and improved camera / camcorder but i never used that feature too much in the first place ultimately i would say this is the reason i returned the alias 2 but i also did not care for the much ballyhooed liquid ink screen when texting you must toggle through 3 screens to find all the numbers / symbols / punctuation marks that you need in fact the third screen only had a scant number of symbols on it so the empty space is frustrating when toggling to the first screen for the letters the empty space is a theme on all screens in fact in either orientation as i said i found this annoying maybe only because i became so used to the 1000 figures / symbols crammed onto the original alias phone pad i ended up returning the alias 2 and going back to the original i will keep my new every 2 discount until verizon comes out with a very good android or apple finally relents with the iphone / at t exclusivity,273,13
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002D0ZN8Y,4.0,positive,when i first heard about this headset i thought wow they are really small i was looking for some external box to support the bluetooth but your seeing pretty much everything that is included in the package and pretty nice carrying case not shown all of the tech is stored in the ear buds and charging is done on one side of the ear plug a very small plug for ac adapter to plug in and charge the headset some reviews i had seen from other sites posted that the headset gets warm after extended use in my case it does not but i have not been using the headset beyond 3 hours of use the feeling in the ears is a little heavy then normal guys with larger canals will not notice much but those with smaller canals would find them a little uncomfortable one of the strange things about bluetooth and plugged ear phones of course is fidelity of the sound and when you wear these sony headset sealed in your ears you get some pretty decent sound not the typical high end fidelity you expect from most plugged ear sets i currently use the headset with my new iphone 3 g s and they work outstanding with a distance of about 20 feet from the iphone the audio for music and podcast is prefect for me the audio for the phone with the mic works perfectly with very little echoing on receivers end of course the biggest con in this review is the price I have managed to get the headset at about 149 but i think for the portability and flexibility for the bluetooth this is an excellent choice,280,0
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002D0ZN8Y,5.0,positive,i wanted to buy a light and stereo bluetooth headset i saw a lot and i tried many from my friend before i choose this it is not very loud and do not painful to the ear but the make me sad is the box was not contain the cylinder carry case,57,5
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002D0ZN8Y,1.0,negative,there is no control whatsoever with these headphones none i should not have to be some kind of techhie geek who knows all the ins and outs of avrcp software nor should i have to search and read through discussion boards to find out what should be basic info provided by the manufacturer sony should state explicitly that these headphones do not work with the iphone period,67,30
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002D0ZN8Y,5.0,positive,super small light and great sound quality the sound quality rivals that of any ear buds i have ever used the battery seem to drain in about 3 to 35 hours but there are no bulky electronics these are literally ear buds without a dangling wire simply awesome,48,13
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002D0ZN8Y,4.0,positive,this is a bluetooth headset that will not illicit looks of contempt or scorn the unit is discreet but sexy and the sound quality is excellent the noise cancelling feature is very effective and is a potential safety issue if you plan to use these outdoors there is only one controll button on the unit that will pause playback answer calls and power on / off the unit i have found the battery life to be fairly short and the microphone is incredibly sensitive so background noise can be a problem with devices that do not allow for configuring mic sensitivity simply put this is an exceptional product but it is not without it is shortcommings apple users should also note compatibility issues with the controll format of this unit if you are like me and want the bleedingof tech this is the solution,143,34
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002D0ZN8Y,3.0,neutral,these sonys are lightweight and comfortable if they work with your phone or mp3 player they are unobtrusive as to be almost invisible unfortunately these do not work well with the iphone 3gs or the palm pre the iphone can not control volume which is ear-splitting loud the volume control disappears and pressing on the volume buttons does nothing the palm pre does control the volume and it works well with the phone but the music does not play too bad because they are nice and lightweight,85,55
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002D0ZN8Y,4.0,positive,i love these except for the volume control the other thing is when i listen to movies on my itouch there is a short delay 1 sec syncing with the mouth saying the words,34,27
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002D0ZN8Y,5.0,positive,i have to admit the sound is not as great as a wired headphone but it is the sacrifice you make for convenience and portability i still think it is the best sounding bluetooth headphone to date i love the discreetness of the headphone people can not even tell you have headphones on i was able to pair with my moto droid with no problems pros no wires best sounding bluetooth headphone in my opinion very discreet high quality unit owned almost a year still works great and i use it about 5x / wk does not work great with iphones i hate anything apple makes especially the iphone cons sound could be a bit louder you need to charge everyday it last for about 2 - 25 hrs of straight listening bit pricey,127,31
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002YB4RDY,4.0,positive,this is a great product especially for the price it was very easy to set up and use the only thing that has disappointed me is the remote which has not worked since day one I am not sure if it is a dead battery or some other issue but plan to contact the seller for a new one overall a great product I am very satisfied and saved a huge amount as opposed to buying the same product at walmart i would absolutely buy this product again,84,290
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002YB4RDY,4.0,positive,works well but it did seem cheaply made and at times it would not pick up the signal or to transmit music,21,9
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002YB4RDY,1.0,negative,i received a usedstatic in frequency signal and headphone wire was flimsy for 7 i got what i paid for not worth it,24,57
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002YB4RDY,1.0,negative,it never turns on when i start my engine i have to disconnect and connect again but at least it saves the station it does not hold my ipod at all,31,60
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002YB4RDY,5.0,positive,well worth the money i did not pay too much for it and my boyfriend used it everyday for a year until it broke he had trouble keeping it upright but fixed it with a little piece of velcro,38,25
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002YB4RDY,1.0,negative,initially it is working fine but some how fm transmitter can not start sometimes i have to unplug and plug it again few times after it get starts i have used this same product for 3years and it works gr8 so i ordered new one as my charging cable was get loose and this newworks awesome,57,63
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002YB4RDY,4.0,positive,works great only thing I am not too happy about is the remote it does not seem to work but the transmitter works well in the car you just have to change the channel away from 881 and i was able to make / receive phone calls and hear the caller on the car speakers shipping was wonderful i received the product in about 2 days,62,92
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002YB4RDY,1.0,negative,as with a lot of ipod accessories the connector cable does not fit in properly to the ipod you have to force it in or rip it outnot something you want to do with a 200,37,184
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002YEIPFM,5.0,positive,why did you choose this rating por que es buy buena y llego todo bien muy contento con la compra,20,9
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002YEIPFM,2.0,negative,this cell phone came in late and on top of that it did not work all that well i live in venezuela and when i arrived here had to pay to get it fixed,33,11
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002YEIPFM,1.0,negative,i bought this product such as new but it is not also i have been trouble because it resets several times I am outside from united states and it took several days to arrived until my hands the seller only gave 30 days guarantee i lost my money,45,0
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002YEIPFM,5.0,positive,new blackberry pearl 8120 unlocked black emerald me gusto la forma en que me llego el producto cumplen con los tiempos establecidos,22,13
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002YEIPFM,3.0,neutral,returned this purchase because it was not as described nothing wrong with the product it had been advertised as the 8120 which works with european sim-cards but i received the 8100 which does not work in europe since it could not be used for my trip i returned it to amazon,50,5
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002YEIPFM,2.0,negative,the battery life sucks one alarm only you can not set multiple alarms you can not upload ringtones without using special software the cell phone is not being recognized by os the lock / unlock mechanism is just stupid you can not lock the phone with combination of key you have to actually click the lock icon can not turn down the ring volume you have to do it thru switching between different preset modes it does not connect to my wifi everything i do not like about a cell phone is there,85,8
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002YEIPFM,1.0,negative,the title of the product is described as new but in the back where the battery has a label that remanufactured in china this seller is a cheat and athank god the blackberry has worked well,38,2
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002YEIPFM,2.0,negative,i got this phone because of it is slim features and the prospect of it is the wi-fi capabilities and has ended up regretting it because i am not being able to talk to anyone and get them to hear me unless i use the speakerphone i donot want to use speakerphone on all of my calls so this is ridiculous do not buy it go for something better,64,1
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0034Z5GY8,4.0,positive,it works only thing i wish is the cable can be a lot shorter the mute button with ipod does not always work well ipod most of the time mistaken it with song play command instead of mic mute a hassle when you are in a call and want to mute but ipod plays a song instead,57,39
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0034Z5GY8,1.0,negative,i bought this to use with my iphone 3gs it does not work as a microphone it does not control music play back it does not start voice control if you hold the button it does not answer calls if you click the button it obviously does not have volume control which i knew ahead of time so basically thisdoes nothing I shall test it out on an iphone 4 but as far as i am concerned thisis falsely advertised,83,25
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0034Z5GY8,3.0,neutral,pros the sound quality of the recordings and skype calls on my 2 g ipod touch is great nice and clear the button on the cord is used as a play / pause button for the music and it works great the pass-through sound to my headphones is good quality as well no degradation that i notice cons the cord is short just under 24 which means you will need to keep you device close to you when using the mic when you add the length of a typical headphone cord 6 feet that puts the mic in somewhat of an awkward position either you have a wad of cord and your device in your shirt pocket or you must talk to you belly button when i plugged in my headset the case for the adapter split open at the seam like it had not been properly fused or glued together a couple of drops of superglue took care of it for under 2 bucks i will not complain takeaway i might buy a few more for the other ipods in the house and maybe experiment with splicing the microphone into a headphone cord closer to a usable position,194,26
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0034Z5GY8,2.0,negative,the product worked well for a few months but by this point the wire connection at the male end is frayed and exposed if i move my iphone around a little i can fool the unit into thinking that the wire noise is a hold button press not bad but I am going to buy a sturdier one when this one breaks in the next few days,66,44
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0034Z5GY8,4.0,positive,thiswas shipped to me in short order and in new condition it worked 100 compatibly with my device i could not ask for anything more,26,35
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0034Z5GY8,3.0,neutral,i use my phone as my music player for my car and when i have my car plugged into the headphone jack on my phone it disables the phones mic so i wanted to get this to solve that problem i also wanted to get this so that i would not have to hold the phone while driving turns out this will not work with my phone i guess if i had a smart phone instead of a dumb phone it would work with it oh well it was cheap so it is not that big of a deal,96,41
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0034Z5GY8,3.0,neutral,it is kind of tedious to use this with headphones you end up having a very long cable in which the microphone is pretty far away from you unless you make a funny little loop on yourself i would partially suggest this although you actually get to use your own headphones the cable does not seem to because any interference in sound quality between directly connecting to my iphone 3 g than with the cable it seems to do exactly as i says just be weary you will have an awkward cable and that is almost enough to not buy it,96,4
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0034Z5GY8,2.0,negative,i bought two of these one for me one for my friend when i opened the first one to try it out it recorded but you could not hear through the headphones no the headphones were not broken i tried the second pair the microphone and the headphones that were plugged into the 35 mm hole worked so it seems to me like it is a 50 chance of them working or not there is a constant problem although with the second one where you have to unplug and replug the jack because it will start echoing the playback through the recording I am assuming there is overlapping wires or something,107,12
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003DR90AS,1.0,negative,used it once before the belt loop snapped in two the first time i sat down and it snagged on the seat not durrable material at all,27,55
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003DR90AS,5.0,positive,this fits a belt really well and was the perfect size for a standard set of handcuffs my brother works in security and he always has this on him i got it for him as a gift a couple years ago and it still is in great condition,48,40
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003DR90AS,3.0,neutral,very large wanted something discreet for off duty this is not it,12,19
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003DR90AS,1.0,negative,i bought two of these and both of them tore during regular use i understand trying to shop cheap but once you ante up for a more expensive case you will thank yourself,32,31
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003DR90AS,4.0,positive,found other uses for these cuff holders when my recent pair came with a pretty good holder i use this for a tape meadur and bandages ace and compression,28,114
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003DR90AS,1.0,negative,strap broke within one week of buying would never buy again and do not recommend,15,56
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003DR90AS,1.0,negative,the first night i used it and was running down some stairs the thing broke if i could give it no stars i would,24,69
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003DR90AS,2.0,negative,had this on my belt for two days before the stitching ripped off the belt loop and the case just fell off poorly constructed very bulky too i could have fit 2 pair of cuffs in it,37,105
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,4.0,positive,stays charged and i can see it fine i even text while it is in the charger i wish it had an easy way to plug into the pc i could do this permanently but i have it plugged into the wall i can pull out a white cable and plug it into pc but it will not be on my charger but I am always at 100 when i leave for the day,72,18
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,2.0,negative,basically i thought it would work with the case that i had on it like the description said i was pretty bummed out when i got it and it did not fit the function that it was meant for,38,42
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,5.0,positive,thisfor the iphone is just what the doctor ordered small sturdy stylish works right out of the box of course i have no case for my iphone so i have no issues with the connector not fitting perfectly as some people have mentioned well worth the money in my view,52,36
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,3.0,neutral,at least not without some modification the cable that comes with it fits in the bumper case just fine so if you want to be able toyour phone without removing the bumper you need to grind out the bracket that holds the cable until the opening is large enough for the cable end to stick through it then you need to glue it in place with the cable end sticking out about 1/16 of an inch once you go to all that hassle it is a pretty great stand or if you do not use the apple bumper case i suppose it would be a great stand without any hassle,109,76
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,4.0,positive,great for night stand or at work desk price is high for what it is but looks nice if lower price i may recommend other to buy it,28,53
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,2.0,negative,the aluminum base it very stylish but the provided charging cord did not work i replaced it with one from apple but with a case or bumper installed the phone would not settle in down far enough to snap into the phone base therefore making it pretty much unusable for me with the replaced cable and removal of the phone case it works fine but not for me,68,90
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,5.0,positive,i bought thisto use with my iphone 4 for charging and downloading pictures it works very well the connector sticks up high enough to engage the receptacle through the otterbox case it also works well just as a stand when i do not need to charge or download i bought the black version which also came with a black usb cable the fit and finish ofand cable is excellent i plan on ordering a second one,79,56
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,2.0,negative,the icrado definitely looks sleek and it is sturdy i have 2 problems with it the connectionpart is not as secure as I had like it this device holds a usb / ipod cable so that you can set your ipod / iphone down onto it unfortunately it moves some because it is not built into the metal part of thealso i have a thin rubber case that wraps around my phone although it has an opening for aat the bottom it sometimes prevents getting a close connection with the icrado i do not completely blame the icrado for that theis cool looking and i like that it comes in black but it is very over priced i bought 2 of them and due to the iffy connection sometimes i can not say that i highly recommend it,138,122
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,1.0,negative,the worst devise it was defective and the return policy attrocious no repsonse from amazon or it is subsidiaries what a sharm i will never buy anything else from amazon ever does not fit properly,34,135
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,4.0,positive,the search is over you can rest now delete all those links you have saved up for the perfect case this one might not be perfect but it certainly comes very close it is simple basic in it is design but that is exactly what i want from a case it fits very well an iphone will never slip out of this case has a matte finish which gives it a good grip and limits the scratches or at least makes the tear / normal usage bearable to look at yes it does provide a bit of difficulty when it comes to pressing the volume or the lock button but this is resolved over time the more you use it the easier it gets do yourself and your iphone a favor and get one,134,115
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,5.0,positive,i looked at the reviews before purchasing this product and must say it is a good buy I have had a few cases before this one and this one rates at the top i had a two piece case to start with which came with the phone from at t and i liked it until i dropped my phone and broke the case the case did do it is job although and the phone was not hurt so i could not complain at all and it was free the next case i purchased was a rubber glove case that fit excellent and i liked it real well until i put it into my pocket and when i went to use the phone the case was covered with fuzz and more this case does not collect lint and it bulks up the phone just enough to make it fit my hands well the phone is too small for me to grip well and i wanted something to protect the phone and make it a little larger this case is perfect for me and i do not have to worry about dropping the phone hope this helps,186,131
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,2.0,negative,i returned this product because while priced well it was not clear at all but instead dingy and yellowed,20,55
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,5.0,positive,i have a white verizon iphone 4 so i wanted to have a case that would allow me to show off the white phone the front glass is protected by a standard film the case slips in and out of my pocket with ease i sometimes put my monthly transit pass in the back of the case so as long as i have my phone with me all i have to do is show the back of it to the bus driver there are two aspects to a phone case 1 it should look good 2 it should protect the phone i was able to verify that this case meets the second when i dropped my phone on a gravel driveway the case protected the back and side of the phone perfectly i hope i do not test the case again update 10/31/11 I have noticed that the case is starting to get discolored it is still transparent but the back of my white iphone is starting to look a little yellow when viewed through the case i bought a couple more of these so i can just change the case every few months,192,95
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,3.0,neutral,this is my first smart phone and so it is also my first smart phone case i got the clear case and it is kind of ugly but in the first month of using it it has already saved my phone from damage when i dropped it the holes for access to ports line up nicely and it does not need to be removed for charging i like the soft grip of the case because it makes for more secure holding and keeps the phone from sliding around inside the car the price was right especially compared to other cases I shall keep it,101,29
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,2.0,negative,i originally bought the clear version of this case for my new iphone 4 and was happy at first after using the clear case for a few days i ran into a few problems including the buttons were almost impossible to press especially when docked the camera flash would not work in the case due to glare after a couple weeks the case already looked yellow i returned this case when i found out that a smoked version was being released we are very happy with the smoked and purple versions beside those issues the case works great the rubber is not too soft as to get caught up in your pocket but stays put on slippery surfaces like a table or dashboard i loved seeing my new phone is complete detail but the trade off for the darker colors are worth it trust me as someone who has been down this road consider the other colors first,155,156
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,3.0,neutral,I have had this case on my iphone4 for a year or so paid msrp it shows off the great design of the iphone fairly slim has enough grip while sliding easily in and out of pockets and has protected the phone from drops on concrete from heights that i would swear should shatter the glass my only complaint and reason for only 3 stars is that over time the clear case has yellowed to a rather unappealingto the point where co-workers have commented on it i would definitely buy this case for my next phone but in one of thetints,105,51
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003V8AM8S,1.0,negative,i compared my case to the one my friend got from the t-mobile store and i liked his much better mine was too flexible and flimsy where as his was much more secure and you could not move it around as much,41,26
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003V8AM8S,3.0,neutral,it is a really nice case with looks and texture quality i end up paying 15 with shipping and tax which is a lot money for this case including everything this case should cost around 6 - 7,36,13

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003V8AM8S,2.0,negative,the very short answer here is if you own a samsung vibrant or other samsung galaxy s phone this silicone case is much too loose i purchased this one and the cheapo-cheapo no name silicone one for about 2 the amzer virtually falls right off while the cheaper one is significantly snugger but actually not quite perfect either with the amzer stick your phone in a pocket the case falls off put it just about anywhere it is in contact with any but smooth smooth surfaces and it just falls off the cheapo-cheapo no name brand fits slightly better if you have found a better one out there please let me know so i can try it,116,29

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041F3A02,2.0,negative,it has no latch so it is constantly getting pulled out of the idevice by the attached cables making it unusable in a car buy this only if the idevice you intend to plug it into and the cables plugged into it will not be moved while it is in use,51,10

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0048AO7A2,3.0,neutral,this is pretty and has a soft velvety feel but the plastic is thick making it hard to reach buttons and i had to enlarge the opening for the charging port the plastic edges are white and really show up,40,19
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0048AO7A2,2.0,negative,this product is inexpensive so i did not mind as much the bad quality but overall it is pretty bad it is a matte finish not a glossy one like the picture and the print starts to peel off after the first couple uses i got it for the sake of having something different to look at but I have ended up going back to my old cases,65,12

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DM0S1M,1.0,negative,absolute crap not worth even the few bucks very bendy and hardly stays in place on the phone at all,20,105
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,5.0,positive,i found this device met my expectations as expected the product worked fine out of the box and functioned as described my only complaint is that the unit is slightly bulkier than i would like the reason i say that is after those long workouts i always do and i am about to pass out and lay down i have to remove the device or have it poke into the back of my head this makes it difficult to call the paramedics that being said i find the unit completely acceptable as is,93,173
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,2.0,negative,i bought these for exercise and they worked well for about two months over time sweat warped the casing on the earpieces and they eventually stopped working the controls were responsive and they sounded ok if you are not planning on wearing these for exercise they are an inexpensive option if you are planning to work out with them I had look elsewhere,60,132
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,2.0,negative,almost good started working well past a week the red light did not worked then past 3 months the gogroove stoped working,21,197
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,5.0,positive,i like these headphones but they can be a bit clumsy if you wear glasses they will not fit as well and seem to move around a bit the basic functionality is good the bluetooth is easy to pair and the rechargeable battery holds more charge than I have been able to use on a run,54,9
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,3.0,neutral,i take the subway every day and with the crowds / backpack and my ear buds cable it is a pain in the butt so i opted for some bluetooth ear buds i usually watch a number of pod cast on my phone and for this reason these s ear buds are fine they do the job hold a charge for a few days and i just throw them in my backpack with no problems but i also like my tunes and for this they are not so good unless the volume is turned down to a very low setting which i can not do on the subway they sound very tinny / cheap i have also tried using them when i walk my dog in the evening and well maybe it is me but again unless turn down they again do not sound so good but as for using them with my phone very good my friends tell me no background noise even when walking down a busy street or standing on a subway platform I have also had them out in the rain with no damage so if you are looking for an entry level bluetooth headset this may be it for you low price point but if your looking for good music sound you might want to keep looking billamac,214,104
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,3.0,neutral,after getting frustrated this morning i figured it was time for a review on these i bought these about 3 months ago wanting to go wireless as i hate running with wires but I am not sure these were the best option I shall keep this short and sweet from a technical standpoint they work great and do what they are supposed to I had give them 5 stars in that category from a functionality standpoint they come up way short if you wanted something to just wear around the house these would be fine but if you are looking at these for running working out or anything where you are moving or sweating I had say move on because of the design you have to bend these to get them to put them on and after doing this a few times I have found you constantly have one side coming out of your ear and are having to stick it back in over and over if you get sweat on the ear buds you can forget about it I have tried to bend them inward but to no avail it can make for quite a frustrating experience I had give them 15 stars in the functionality category if you are looking for something for exercise look elsewhere i wish i had went with the lg tone and will probably purchase them in the near future i wish you could give half stars I had give an overall of 25 since i can not i m just giving them 3 since technically they do work,255,119
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,4.0,positive,this handfree nice and good but her voice some low but i like this so much and easy for used,20,250
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,1.0,negative,this is not designed to get wet in any manner if you sweat just a little it will break mine lasted 45 days before it broke do not waste your money find something else it is also uncomfortable behind the ear so i can not even recommend it if you are only going to listen to music and use for a phone,60,158
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004E7EKV0,3.0,neutral,perhaps i stuffed it too much it is a great little tool although I am still using it even with the ripped it ripped at the edges of the zipper it is a shame because i really like,35,17
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004E7EKV0,3.0,neutral,i ordered this in hopes of having a compact way to carry my phone and extra battery as i read the description i compared the dimensions to my phone the case really is bigger than the dimensions indicated i am still using it to store accessories in my backpack but would never wear this on my belt,57,13
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004E7EKV0,2.0,negative,this case is just what i need for my new mp3 player it holds the player and peripherals looks good and even has a place for a stylus should i decide to buy one however i must comment on the quality of this merchandise less than 5 minutes after removing it from the box one of the zipper hasps plastic but painted silver to look like metal snapped off hopefully some crazy glue will remedy this situation but this is why this gets 2 stars instead of 4,88,4
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004E7EKV0,2.0,negative,this product failed within the first two weeks and had to be returned product design was also not good for the use of the belt loop too much top heavy return and credit were easy,35,29

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004KPLA9Q,4.0,positive,the mistake most buyers do myself included is that we tend to compare products with other products so it all comes down to what are you looking for i have an iphone4 and paired up with the jabra stone2 it is simply a dynamic duo is much better than it 's predecessor and the features i was looking for is music streamed good sound quality fast conectivity and i could easily drive and pick up calls so it completely met my needs now i have to be honest i gave it four stars because the only thing that need improvement is the battery while listening music it only lasts 1 hour and 30 minutes then you have to recharge it but that is why you have the trusty pebble charger which complemets perfect the poor battery life i just charge it again for 30 minutes and it is good to go for up to three or four charges so over all dispite the battery life i love it and recommend anyone to buy it,172,136
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004KPLA9Q,3.0,neutral,it only allow you to make call for 90 mins or so and you will need to charge it also it is not as comfort as marketed i wear 3 - 4 hours during a tradeshow and it is almost killed me,40,76
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004KPLA9Q,1.0,negative,i am very disappointed in this product very short standby or talk time the stone that you have to have for charging is a nuisance and you are out of luck for turning the unit off or recharge it if you left it behind on many occasions rather than charging the unit when not plugged in to a usb or wall socket it drained it of the remaining charge the communication they claim for answer or ignore stopped working with my droid after a week and never came back it will not stay in my ear canal and when i push it back in because of the placement of the answer hangup button it always starts the battery level message i now hate the voice from hearing it so much i have had several people tell me that they can not hear me due to background noise and have had to move to a quiet place or roll up the window of my truck in order to have a conversation it has also dropped several calls when i press the answer button as soon as i receive my replacement jawbone this is going in the trash,196,143
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004KPLA9Q,4.0,positive,i recently received a jabra journey visor mounted blue tooth as a gift it is a most excellent product despite it is reasonable pricing however i also bought a jabra stone 2 wireless blue tooth earpiece over many years i have owned a number of blue tooth earpieces and none have equaled the sound clarity ease of operation and quality workmanship of this jabra product however unfortunately it did not fit my ear canal properly with any of the different sized earbuds that came with this blue tooth and i am hoping that jabra will allow me to return this product for credit were it not for the I shall fitting earbud my goofy shaped ear canals perhaps i would not consider returning this most excellent product thank you jabra many manufactures could learn much from your keen manufacturing abilities and fair pricing michael pierce southcoast oregon,145,113

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004KPLA9Q,1.0,negative,i like it but it really does not work it runs out of battery in 3 hours and sometimes the voice on call is stadicy and the volume goes up and down by itself,33,15
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004KPLA9Q,1.0,negative,i have been a fan of jabra in the past but this is a terrible disappointment i do not recommend the jabra stone,23,18

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004R91G1C,3.0,neutral,i received thisfast it was exactly as pictured which i loved the print that is why it was ordered in the first place the only downside to thiswas the print did not stay on long with normal wear and tear of everyday use the pink and the pattern started rubbing off i think i was able to use this case as is for maybe 2 weeks after i purchased it but it was excellent for the money,79,11

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004SK6OOO,4.0,positive,it took more than a week to deliver this tiny ear plugs but it was in the range of the estimated delivery so i can not complain about it this ear plugs are pretty neat the blue looks pretty cool and i have not tried the mic so i hope it works I am using htc inspire 4 g and it works great on my phone too,63,0
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004SK6OOO,2.0,negative,yes you do get what you pay for but why is everyone writing reviews saying it has good sound quality breaking is not a problem it does not break please do not buy this everyone says it has good sound quality cowdung horrible sound quality has a wierd echo-ish empty room faint playback please do not listen to these idiot reviews bad bad do not buy eforcity,66,70
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004SK6OOO,3.0,neutral,they seem to work well and are functional however the end pieces sometimes come off i think they were designed that way so you can change out the ear pieces if need be but sometimes wen I am running they will just come off other then that no issues especially when I am just lounging around listening to music ps the piece pops right back on no worries,65,22
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004SK6OOO,5.0,positive,these are amazing they lasted me over 2 months being as although i usually buy a pair or two pair every month because i have cats that just love to mess with me the sound quality of these earbuds is amazing the microphone is perfect i love these,49,12
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004SK6OOO,3.0,neutral,ease of ordering was good shipment time was good i really could not ask for anything more than what i got considering the price i paid prior reviews about quality was dead on but like i said you get what you pay for,42,56

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004SK71C8,4.0,positive,i liked it it has good sound quality and is perfect because it hangs down perfect and not in the way like other ear phones,25,181
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004SK71C8,3.0,neutral,not very good sound quality but decent for what you pay for since it has a remote and mic usually most headphones cost twice as much remote is a bit awkwardly placed and the cord is a bit short but not a hindrance,43,119
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004SK71C8,2.0,negative,i ordered 3 pairs of these and they each lasted for under 2 months inspite of the fact that i did not even use them regularly because the sound quality was poor and and i only got sound from 1 ear after 3 - 4 weeks if you are looking for headphones to last you for a few months then this is the product for you,62,139
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004SK71C8,3.0,neutral,i would give this product 5 stars except there has no volume control on the headset or if there is I am too stupid to figure it out,26,216

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004SK71C8,2.0,negative,when i first got them i was bummed that they were not of same length i hate that about earphones they did not last as long either,25,115
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004SPLDA4,2.0,negative,was kind of dissapointed in the cell phone case i love the cheeta print but it just seems like it is very cheaply made and the black prints scratch right off disappointed,31,8
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004SPLDA4,5.0,positive,my case is perfect fits a lot better then the one i purchased at the swapmeat i would recommend,20,13
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004SPLDA4,3.0,neutral,the case fits well but i noticed it had a couple scratches on it but it is not noticeable it is nice for the cost,25,9

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004SPLDA4,1.0,negative,not at all what i ordered this makes me angry i saw the picture and thought it was just a mess up on the typing when i recived it it dissapointed me the picture should show the same as what the order is just saying,46,0
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004SPLDA4,4.0,positive,the case itself is really nice the material the case was made out of was pretty cheap when i put i on the case cracked almost immediately,27,11
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004SPLDA4,4.0,positive,but i ordered it for the wrong phone i wish i would have payed more attention to what i was ordering it was a sturdy looking case and it was very cute,31,16
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004SPLDA4,3.0,neutral,i love this case it is so so cute but it peals so quickly i like the feel of it the materiel even keeps your phone still in the car on my leather seats,34,17
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004X4VNNM,5.0,positive,i have had a lot of compliments on the cover and it fits into my leather case i can wear on my belt when i do not want to carry a purse,32,27
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004X4VNNM,1.0,negative,even although you will only be paying a few bucks for this product it is still not worth it this product is not durable whatsoever after only a week of having it i dropped my phone and the entire thing fell apart it was completely broken the actual phone cover is much uglier than the picture this product is basically cheap completely useless and ugly,63,15
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004X4VNNM,3.0,neutral,this is a very cute case but after only having it for like a month the paint is chipping off in numerous places and the case is broken because whenever it is dropped even from a short height the front of the case pops off so it was cheap and sort of did it is job but I am going back to the silicone cases,62,23
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004X4VNNM,4.0,positive,this product was contructed very well pretty and fit my phone the price was good and i would purchase similar items in the future,24,17
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004X4VNNM,4.0,positive,good fit for htc incredible 2 newer model released in may 2011 around very basic snap on case you need to snap the sides carefully otherwise they may come off looks good but this is just a painted plastic cover will protect again scratch and minor jolt like if you keep it among many other things inside a ladies purse or glove box but may not survive a fall from your hand on road or hard floor i think it is worth for the money because same thing in any mall you have to pay probably 3 to 5 times,99,8
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004X4VNNM,5.0,positive,this case is exactly what i wanted it is cute and it is durable it snaps over the incredible 2 perfectly it protects the phone from damage yet it also makes it girlie i even dropped my phone on the sidewalk the case popped off but it took all the damage which actually was very little my phone was still in perfect condition this case does not protect the screen you need to buy something seperate to do that the case was cheap too and shipped fast good buy,87,9
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004X4VNNM,5.0,positive,i ordered this product and it was shipped fast and arrived in a timely manor i originally bought a plain white case from the verizon store when i first got the product and it sucked this was a 1/3 the price and at least twice the quality it is protected my phone from a couple of falls and the design is beautiful great product would recommend,65,28
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004X4VNNM,3.0,neutral,i purchased this cover along with two others it snaps on easily and the holes for the camera and light are placed perfectly i was not able to use one of the covers because it did not fit properly but this cover is a great product definitely worth it just wish they did not charge additional shipping for the same bag i paid nearly 12 shipping for 300 worth of merchandise in one small bubble package but at least i saved about 50 in the long run for covers at any other place,90,24
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XTKGSA,4.0,positive,the case is good for the price the case does not cover the volume buttons bottom or top of the phone,21,35
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XTKGSA,1.0,negative,i was highly disappointed with the quality of thisi absolutely did not put it on my phone the picture of the camera is fuzzy and pixelated horrible quality embarrassing,31,13
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XTKGSA,4.0,positive,i find this to produce a nice retro camera look the graphics are high quality and durable on the phone i get compliments on it i have a 4s and the room for the buttons is fine,37,26
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XTKGSA,3.0,neutral,i purchased this for my iphone 4s and it fits perfectly no hassles what-so-ever i can access all buttons and use the usb charger with the case on I am not for sure if the case is made well sure it feels strong but is it strong enough i guess I shall find out when i eventually drop my phone anyhow my only real complaint is the camera sticker / cover is not sharp and rich in detail it is not pixelated but simply looks blurred or the cover used came from a scanned image kinda upsetting but i have no intentions on sending the product back or buying an alternative case / cover also my phone did not arrive in the package as pictured above it was opened and bubble wrapped,125,30
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XTKGSA,2.0,negative,i got the radio cover as a christmas gift in less then a month the paint started chipping after leaving a trail of chipped away radio everywhere i go i scratched the rest off I am hoping the case itself will last me until the new iphone is released,49,16
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XTKGSA,5.0,positive,this is a hard plastic cover that fits snugly but allows room for the function buttons i had a transistor radio when i was a kid so i love the way the case looks very clever product shipped quickly and was reasonably priced,43,31
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XTKGSA,3.0,neutral,the calculator design is great makes your phone seem like a vintage calculator great for tricking your friends or breaking thehowever protection wise not so great the cover is made of really weak plastic and does not offer much protection for your iphone personally i cracked it within a week,51,21
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XTKGSA,1.0,negative,i love the image look shape and feel of the case but the image peeled off like a sticker after only about a week total bummer,26,12
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XV0UX4,1.0,negative,it broke right before i use it i am very upset and frustrated about this product this is one good example of made in china,25,80
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XV0UX4,4.0,positive,this would work well for most i was using this in reference to a guide on how to use an android phone with a dslr in short however there are limitations on the device in general although it does as described there is a limit to the width on theit is plastic so expect it to bend a bit but it definitely still holds it in firmly the model phone i was trying to hold in it was the motorola atrix 2 it is a bit wider phone and barely fits but it fits snug and comfortable i would feel confidant using it in the field the side adjustable part of this mount has a small ratchet mechanism basically just manual pressure holding nothing specific it opens and closes when the atrix is in the mount itself since to expose the usb it has to be a little further past the end of the bottom part of the mount not a big deal but it does not fit 100 regardless of the issues it is a spring hold not screw tighten mount cheap but does the job very well and securely no complaints here for a cheap cell phone tripod,198,77
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XV0UX4,1.0,negative,i used it once and it broke so ridiculously cheap i know you get what you pay for but seriously the plastic arms fell off and the spring inside broke it is in the trash what a waste of time buying a new gorilla pod now,47,73
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XV0UX4,4.0,positive,bought this for the iphone 4 and it works really great having used this for about a year and it still has not give up on me even although it was fairly cheap overall a really great product and the seller i got it from came really fast i was amazed,50,94
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XV0UX4,2.0,negative,i bought this as a stand for my phone to use for facetime it lasted but all of a month the cheap plastic hook part snapped,26,33
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XV0UX4,1.0,negative,i do not know how this mount works because it snapped into two pieces the first time i tried to fit my ipod 5 g into it the table top tripod looked like a cheap toy i tossed the whole mess into the trash and ordered another mount istabilizer that cost three times as much i learned my lesson about bargain products,60,79
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XV0UX4,3.0,neutral,it barely does what has its supposed to do i tried to attach it to my iphone 3 with an otterbox and the top arm pulled out and almost broke off immediately i realize that maybe it is just not for a phone with an otterbox the bottom silver legs pull out but do not lock so any amount of pressure at all sends them telescoping back up into the black legs when all three legs are open it still stands crooked on the desk it is wobbly reeealy lightweight and flimsy it does the job but barely and I am sure it will not be long before it breaks,104,69
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XV0UX4,4.0,positive,it does a great job during face talk the stand is good for the price easy to carry from palce to place,22,42
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004YKZPHU,4.0,positive,the case arrived in a plastic package and bubble wrap it is easy to use and very protective however it is very hard to get off,26,0
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004YKZPHU,4.0,positive,I am writing my review based on the fact that the company replaced my 1st case due to an unusual experience the case works great hopefully i will not have the same problem,31,1
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004YKZPHU,4.0,positive,purchased this case about 3 weeks ago it was much nicer than i expected feels good to touch looks good on phone but i do agree with the other review it attracts dirt but what can u hope for it is a white case highly recommened great value,47,5
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004YKZPHU,1.0,negative,this case did not snapped on all the way it was worth the penny i paid glad i did not spend more than a few bucks for it you get what you pay for,33,15
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004YKZPHU,5.0,positive,snaps together and stays together neat and sleek looking textured enough not to slide around not at all bulky but still gives adequate protection,24,11
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004YKZPHU,5.0,positive,i love how it feels it reminds me of a body glove case but it way better than that brand i bought a body glove case for twenty dollars and it broke within two days this one was so soft but yet hard like it was not rubberized i like it,50,14
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004YKZPHU,2.0,negative,the case came after 3 weeks and a corner of it was messed up so it does not snap together good i like the cover just would of liked it if the corner was not messed up and it came like that somehow it got nessed up a bit,49,8

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0053E9OSC,1.0,negative,i did not receive this product when i ordered it for the 1st time when i contacted the seller they sent me the protector again this is a pack of 2 screen protectors the screen protector had scratches when we looked at it carefully on opening and there was a sticker reading peel it here this sticker did not come out easily and gives a sticky appearance at the screen corner not worth buying she shall out some money and buy a good screen protector,84,0

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0053EBBH4,3.0,neutral,the hook falls off the earbud too easily if you place the earloops hooks and the earbud in your shirt pocket pants pocket or purse it can easily seperate otherwise it works well,33,43
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0053EBBH4,5.0,positive,my wife has small ears and likes the fit with her jawbone icon quality seems as good as the original that was lost,23,24
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0053EBBH4,1.0,negative,these do not seem to fit my jawbone correctly looks correct but fails to stay clipped on device when placed in pocket,21,37

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0054EQQXC,5.0,positive,i have been looking for this case everywhere i bought it at j crew originally two years ago it fell apart from wear and tear I am so glad i was able to find a replacement it is great for the price but probably will not last too long I am thinking a few months but great for a quick change in look for my phone,62,29
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0054EQQXC,4.0,positive,it is good fits fine i was expecting the cover to have stones not a glitter type texture the glitter does not go all over the place but if picked at or played with much a piece or two will come off other than that shipping took a bit of a while but i was in no rush to have it and the price was great,65,144
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0054EQQXC,1.0,negative,i was really excited for this case because i wanted to add sparkle to my phone the case is made from a very cheap material and only covers the back of the phone the case did not fit on the left hand side at the top either it felt like it would have fallen off really easily if i had dropped it this case does not provide any protection for the front of the phone either i like cases that come up over the sides and a little on the front so you get a good fit and this one did not fit the bill if you are looking for just sparkle with no protection than this case would work but if you need a case that will protect your phone when it is dropped look for a different case,138,163
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0054EQQXC,1.0,negative,the quality is cheap and the sparkles constantly keep falling off not worth it no matter how cheap it is,20,166

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0054ERLD6,5.0,positive,i love the sparkles my friends love it to i just might order more if it could come to me sooner,21,26
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0054ERLD6,1.0,negative,it fits the phone well but the glitter pulls off too easily and it just looks awkward maybe it looks better on a black phone,25,4
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0054ERLD6,2.0,negative,at first glance it is exactly what i thought it was a cheap phone cover immediately the glitter started falling off it ended up everywhere i used the phone cover for 2 days before i took it off and threw it away,41,39
